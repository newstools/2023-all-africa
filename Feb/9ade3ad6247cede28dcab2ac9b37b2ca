Africa holds mineral wealth with diverse commodities that are sought-after the world over. In the diamond industry, revenues elude local communities despite multilateral certification measures. In diamond-rich parts of Africa, the revenue generated from mineral extraction does little to improve of the quality of life of the people who live in those countries, with Botswana being the only exception. Instead of uplifting communities through mineral riches, many people find themselves stuck in a vicious cycle of exploitation and abuse, Neusa E Silva writes for Deutsche Welle. As one of Africa's major natural resources, diamonds are supposed to be helping transform Africa and the lives of its people. However, according to data from the African Diamond Council, smuggled rough diamonds of African provenance account for an estimated 28% to 32% of total African diamond production earnings.
