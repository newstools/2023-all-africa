Pope Francis urged Catholic bishops, priests and nuns in South Sudan to speak out against abuse of power and injustice in the country during an address on Saturday February 4, 2023. The pope was taking part in a "pilgrimage of peace" to South Sudan along with Protestant Christian church leaders in an effort to urge the country's leaders to recommit to implementing a peace deal. After leaving South Sudan, Pope Francis took umbrage with those who used Pope Benedict XVI's death to attack the church. Prior to his papal visit to South Sudan, Francis traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to raise awareness for those affected by conflict.
