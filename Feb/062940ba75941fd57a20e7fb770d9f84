After two years of intense consultations around the world, the Peacemaking Covenant was developed to be a framework for action to negotiate sustainable peace. The Geneva-based Principles for Peace initiative is a global participatory initiative that was set up to develop new principles, standards, and norms to fundamentally reshape peace processes and chart a path to sustainable peace. Their shared mission is to re-examine how we build and consolidate peace in an era defined by resurgent conflict. There are currently more than 50 conflicts taking place worldwide, impacting the lives of more than two billion people, and more than half of those conflicts that are supposedly resolved recur three times or more. AllAfrica's Nontobeko Mlambo spoke to Ambassador Frederic Gateretse-Ngoga, a member of the International Commission on Inclusive Peace at Principles for Peace who is currently serving as Focal Point for Partnerships, AUBP & Regional Security Mechanism Office of the Commissioner for Political Affairs and Peace and Security, Political Affairs and Security Department at the African Union.
