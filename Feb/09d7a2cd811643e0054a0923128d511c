Climate change and some humanitarian crises are cited as contributing to the outbreaks that Somalia, Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia, Cameroon, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Malawi are seeing right now. Malawi is the most affected African country with more than 1,200 people dead and over 40 000 cases reported since March 2022.  WHO has warned that if the current trend continues, cases could surpass the number recorded in 2021 - the worst year for cholera in Africa in nearly a decade.
