President George Weah took office on January 22, 2018. He is a member of the Congress for Democratic Change, which he established in 2004. Since taking office, Weah has faced many challenges - the most recent of which are accusations by opposition parties that his administration is not tackling growing corruption. Weah has announced his intention to run for a second term in office in the October 2023 general elections - a move that some opposition leaders are opposing. In his final state of the nation address, Weah assured the nation that leading to the October 2023 polls, his administration "will continue to accelerate, continue to build on the momentum, and continue to deliver". The president said he will be going to Liberians to ask them to renew, for a second time, the mandate they gave him six years ago.
