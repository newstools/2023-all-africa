Democratic Republic of Congo's Dr Jean Kaseya has been selected by the African Union as the next director general of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the agency that helps member states deal with health emergencies and design programmes to deal with public health. Kaseya replaces Cameroonian-American virologist John Nkengasong who, since May 2022, has been leading and overseeing U.S. President Joe Biden's Programme for the Fight Against HIV/AIDs (PEPFAR). Kaseya confirmed his appointment and immediately underlined the importance of working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) on issues ranging from universal health coverage in Africa to strengthening local manufacturing capacity in the post-COVID era. The CDC is the largest health organization in Africa. The organization has been very active in combating the Covid-19 pandemic on the continent, particularly by coordinating vaccine distribution.
