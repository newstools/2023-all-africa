Although investing in school health and nutrition has a positive effect on children's academic outcomes, one-third of schools worldwide still do not have access to drinking water and basic sanitation facilities, three UN agencies said in a report published on February 9, 2023. The report titled: Ready to Learn and Thrive: School Health and Nutrition Around the World - shows that the provision of school health and nutrition incentivise children to come to school and to stay there. School meals alone increase enrolment and attendance rates by 9% and 8%, respectively. It is estimated that some 584 million children have limited, or no access to basic drinking water services at school. Nearly half live in sub-Saharan Africa, according to a study by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP). The three organisations are appealing to the international community, countries, and partners to step up actions to protect and promote the physical and mental health, nutrition, well-being, and development of all learners. All stakeholders are urged to focus on key interventions appropriate to local contexts and needs, including the provision of school meals; vaccinations; de-worming; psycho-social support; skills-based health education that enables learners to lead healthy lives; and safe and inclusive learning environments that promote health and well-being.
