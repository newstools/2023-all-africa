South Africa's department of health is not planning to buy the Covid-19 bivalent vaccine boosters specifically tailored to target Omicron variants soon, Adele Baleta writes for Spotlight. Instead, people in South Africa will continue to be offered the Pfizer-BioNtech and Johnson and Johnson (J&J) booster doses.  The bivalent boosters include a component of the original Covid-19 strain to provide broad protection, and a component of the omicron variant to target subvariants.  South Africans over 60 years of age, and who have comorbidities, are urged to get their booster shots. South Africa was the hardest hit country in Africa with over 4 million reported cases and 103,000 deaths.
