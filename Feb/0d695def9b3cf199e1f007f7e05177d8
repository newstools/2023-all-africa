Nigeria's State Security Service (SSS) has alleged in court documents in the possession of Premium Times,Â  that the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria Godwin Emefiele, has been funding "unknown gunmen" and members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), writes Ameh Ejekwonyilo for Premium Times. Premium Times reports that the documents provide for the first time, the missing details of the terrorism financing allegation which the SSS levelled against the Central Bank governor. In December 2022 Justice M. A. Hassan of a High Court in Abuja, restrained the Department of State Services (DSS) and four others from arresting or detaining the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele over alleged trumped up charges bordering on terrorism financing, Alex Enumah wrote for This Day.
