Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as Doctors Without Borders, have been operating in Burkina Faso since 1995. The organisation closed its doors in 2015, due to escalating conflict. It returned in 2017 and now, following a deadly attack on staff members, are leaving the country again. In a statement, MSF said: "Following the attack in which two MSF staff were killed on February 8, 2023 in the Boucle du Mouhoun region, we are suspending all our activities in the country. This measure, necessary for the time of mourning, is essential to analyze the risks to which our teams are currently exposed.
