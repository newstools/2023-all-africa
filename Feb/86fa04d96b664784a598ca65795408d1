Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) fear that the government could close them down after the Senate passed a bill that gives the government greater control over their operations. The National Association of Non-Governmental Organisations (NANGO), an umbrella body with close to 800 active members, believes that some of the bill's clauses are repressive and will limit work in vulnerable communities. The government has often accused western governments of using NGOs to destabilise the country, to benefit the opposition. NGOs have increased in number in Zimbabwe to provide services to communities struggling with the economic crisis. President Emmerson Mnangagwa now has 21 days to sign or reject the bill. In January 2023, Zimbabwe deregistered 291 NGOs citing their failure to submit annual tax returns, as well as national security reasons and allegedly straying from their mandate.
