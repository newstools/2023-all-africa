Hope of finding work is the leading factor driving people to join fast-growing violent extremist groups in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to a new report, Journey to Extremism in Africa: Pathways to Recruitment and Disengagement, by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The UNDP in 2021 interviewed nearly 2 200 people across eight countries torn by jihadist or other violent groups - Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. The interviews included nearly 1 200 former members of extremist groups, of whom nearly 900 had joined voluntarily while the others had been coerced. Of those who had voluntarily joined, 40% said the prospect of paid work had been their primary motive, UNDP said in a report. Religious motivations and being able to be with family or friends were the other reason for joining. However, the report also identified factors that drive recruits to leave armed groups, such as unmet financial expectations, or a lack of trust in the group's leadership.
