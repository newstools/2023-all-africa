After two failed attempts at an overhaul of Nigeria's mental health act - in 2003 and 2013 - President Muhammadu Buhari, in January 2021, signed into law the nation's first mental health bill, the National Mental Health Act. This came over six decades after the Lunacy Act of 1958 was established, giving medical practitioners the power to detain people with mental illnesses,Â write Aloysius Ugwu and Beti Baiye for Nigeria Health Watch. The Lunacy Ordinance enacted in 1916, which preceded the 1958 Lunacy Act, was Nigeria's first mental health legislation. The new Act is a significant step forward for mental health in Nigeria as it seeks to promote and protect the lives of people with mental illnesses, while also addressing and correcting the flaws in the old Lunacy Act.
