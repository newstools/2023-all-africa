South African Tourism (SAT), is the marketing arm of the Department of Tourism. A decision made by SAT to sponsor English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur to the tune of almost U.S.$57 million in a three-year deal beginning in the 2023/24 English Premier League season and ending at the end of the 2026/27 season.- has been met with outrage by the South African public, writes Jerry Chifamba for AllAfrica. The 36-month deal would include branding on players' kits and access to stadium hospitality for South African Tourism. The public outcry over the deal has been echoed by President Cyril Ramaphosa who said the decision was "not justified", News24 reports. The president's office has denied that he will announce the deal in the State of the Nation address on February 10, 2023 and has said the president still has to be briefed on the proposal. Meanwhile there are several twists to the tale since the Daily Maverick reported on the proposed plan. Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has washed her hands, denying she knew anything of the deal. Added to that, despite SA Tourism's (SAT) assurance of no "middle-man" involvement, it was revealed on the SAT CEO Themba Khumalo's slide presentation that over U.S.$1 million will be paid to Tottenham Hotspur by WWP Group, a PR firm that SAT's Chief Financial Officer Johan Van Der Walt has direct links to. Following the news, three board members from South African Tourism - Enver Duminy, Ravi Nadasen, and Rosemary Anderson, resigned with immediate effect, according to eNCA. The resignations were reportedly received by the tourism minister. Meanwhile, the public waits to see the outcome of the Tottenham Hotspur deal.
