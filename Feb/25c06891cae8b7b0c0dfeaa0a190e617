Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) leaders have called for a transparent and comprehensive investigation into the killing of human rights defender, lawyer and activist, Thulani Maseko, at his home near Manzini on January 21, 2023. The leaders, who were meeting for a special SADC summit, also called for the country's national dialogue to go ahead and address the concerns of the people of eSwatini. In 2021, SADC sent special envoys to King Mswati after police opened fire on pro-democracy protesters. At the time, Human Rights Watch said that eSwatini police fired live ammunition and teargas into a bus full of people travelling to the capital, Mbabane, on October 20, 2021 to protest the jailing of two pro-democracy members of parliament - Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube.
