Among the EU's latest package of Russian sanctions announced on February 25, 2023, members of the Wagner Group mercenary company were included for alleged crimes committed in Africa. The group's exact African footprint is disputed, but it's growing, writes Deutsche Welle. The Wagner Group was already placed under EU sanctions in 2021. The additional sanctions were brought against it for alleged human rights abuses committed in the Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan and Ukraine.
