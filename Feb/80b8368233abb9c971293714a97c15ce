Kenya's Nyeri County has borne the brunt of the drought ravaging the country and the East African region. The government has since the beginning of February 2023, spent at least U.S.$62 million on food for the people of that region. With rains failing for the fourth consecutive year, many regions in northern Kenya have been experiencing the worst drought in years. Some areas, like central Kenya, which for a long time enjoyed surplus food production and high yields, have seen crops drying up, harvests dwindling and hunger growing. High malnutrition rates, particularly among children, have emerged in many counties. Now USAID has joined the government with an announcement of U.S.$126 million in additional food assistance to Kenya. The announcement comes following a visit to the country by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden. The funds will be used to meet the urgent needs for approximately 1.3 million people across the country. Emergency food items such as sorghum, maize, yellow split peas, and vegetable oil for families living in areas where local markets are not functioning, will be provided, USAID has said.
