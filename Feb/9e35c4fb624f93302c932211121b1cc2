Roger Winter, indefatigable proponent for the people of South Sudan and the region, who died on January 25, 2023, is remembered by three veteran activists and close collaborators - Eric Reeves, John Prederngast and Ted Dagne. They recall his "decades-long work and passionate campaigns for the people of South Sudan," as well as his advocacy for refugees worldwide."He never tired of advocating for the people of Sudan, South Sudan, Rwanda, Congo, and many more," they write. In another tribute, scholar and diplomat Francis Deng describes Winter's "dedicated advocacy for the cause of the marginalized groups" and his unparalleled focus on Sudan and South Sudan. "With his death, the world has lost a discreet, understated great defender of humanitarian ideals of human dignity for all," Deng writes.. "South Sudan, in particular, has lost a great friend and a staunch supporter of their liberation struggle against the systemic domination and denigration by oppressive regimes."
