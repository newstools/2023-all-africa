Roger Winter, a indefatigable proponent for the people of South Sudan and the region, died on January 25, 2023. Three veteran activists who worked closely with Winter - Eric Reeves, John Prederngast and Ted Dagne - recall his "decades-long work and passionate campaigns for the people of South Sudan," as well as advocacy for refugees worldwide. In another tribute, Farcis Deng - scholar and diplomat - describes Winter's "dedicated advocacy for the cause of the marginalized groups" and his unparalleled focus on Sudan and South Sudan.
