Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana has delivered his 2023 Budget speech, saying: "This is not an austerity Budget. It is a Budget that makes tough trade-offs in the interests of the country's short- and long-term prosperity." The speech was delivered to parliament on February 22, against a backdrop of world economic decline, the effects of Covid-19 and the increasing impact of the country's energy crisis.
