Swiss President Alain Berset will visit the troubled Cabo Delgado province this week during a trip to Mozambique and Botswana. His visit comes in the year Switzerland assumed the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council for the first time. Cabo Delgado remains deep in crisis almost five years after extremist violence began in the region. Since October 2017, Cabo Delgado has come under attack by militants - causing death of more than 3,000 people and displacing over 850,000 others - leading to a humanitarian crisis. The attacks - many of which were accompanied by atrocities - included beheadings and the destruction of public and private infrastructure.
