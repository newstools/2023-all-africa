South Africa is hosting a joint naval exercise, Exercise Mosi II, with Russia and China. The Russian military frigate "Admiral Gorshkov" was greeted by protests when it arrived in Cape Town harbour ahead of naval exercises hosted by South Africa from February 17 to 27, 2023. This year's exercise will see over 350 South African National Defence Force personnel from various divisions, participating. South Africa's Western allies are unhappy about the exercise. The European Union's top diplomat Josep Borrell said - in a joint press conference with his South African counterpart Naledi Pandor - that the planned naval activities were "not the best thing." The exercise coincides with the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Observers find extremely awkward especially because South Africa has refused to condemn Moscow's aggression, insisting it wants to stay neutral. South Africa is part of the BRICS group with Russia, India, China, and Brazil which was started as a forum for trade ties among rising economic powers.
