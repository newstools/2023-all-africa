Africa in 2022 saw flooding and landslides occur on an unprecedented scale. Many leaders - including DR Congo's President Felix Tshesekedi - blamed the phenomenon on the climate crisis. Judging from extreme weather in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique it looks like Africa will continue to feel the impact of this phenomenon. South Africa saw devastating floods in the KwaZulu-Natal province and the Gauteng province in 2022. The government declared a state of disaster for both regions and started to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure that were swept away. When more rains fell, hundreds of people lost their lives. Now the rains have returned, causing enough damage for the government to again declare another state of disaster for KwaZulu-Natal province on February 14, 2023. Meanwhile flooding hit Zimbabwe in 2022, and in neighbouring Mozambique - affected by three natural disasters during the cyclone season (October 2021 to April 2022). Tropical Cyclone Gombe struck on March 11, 2022, leaving devastation in its wake. The cyclone affected 736,000 people and displaced 23,000 people. This cyclone followed two extreme weather events - Tropical Storm Ana and Tropical Depression Dumako which had struck six weeks earlier, affecting 200,000 people. Tropical Storm Ana struck Malawi on January 24, 2022, sparking a call for international aid from the UN. On December 13, 2022 heavy rains in DR Congo, led to devastating landslides that saw thousands of people lose their lives.Â  The climate crisis in Africa will continue having devastating consequences until action is taken to mitigate the loss of life and damage to infrastructure. It is also impacting areas such as health and is resulting in various outbreaks, including the spread of Cholera.
