President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a national State of Disaster - with immediate effect - as a response to the current energy crisis. The president made the accouncement during his annual State of the Nation address on February 9, 2023. He also announced that he would be appointing a Minister of Electricity in the Presidency, whose sole focus would be to bring the country out of the current energy deficit. South Africans face rotational periods of "load shedding", in which power may be cut for hours a day as power utility Eskom is unable to supply enough electricity to meet demand. The president had barely completed his address when the opposition Democratic Alliance announced it was going to court over the declared state of disaster. Voice of America reports that he faced drama at the start of his address, which he began about 45 minutes late after opposition lawmakers, mainly from the Economic Freedom Fighters party, disrupted proceedings. After the speaker of parliament told them to leave, a group of EFF MPs tried to barge onto the stage before security intervened. The president also announced measures that will address other key issues facing South Africans - reducing unemployment; poverty and the rising cost of living; and combating crime and corruption.
