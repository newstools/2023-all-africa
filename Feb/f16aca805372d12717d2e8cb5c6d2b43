Nigeria's former Minister of State for Health, Dr Muhammad Ali Pate, has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of the global vaccine alliance, GAVI. Dr Pate will assume his role on August 3, 2023, when he will take over from Seth Berkley, who has led the alliance for the past 12 years, GAVI announced on Monday February 13, 2023. Dr Pate is medical doctor trained in both internal medicine and infectious diseases, with an MBA from Duke University in the United States. He served as Nigeria's Minister of State for Health between 2011 and 2013. In that role, he led a flagship initiative to revive routine vaccinations and primary health care, chaired a presidential taskforce to eradicate polio and introduced new vaccines into the country. His success at persuading rural communities to accept the polio vaccination - overcoming widespread misinformation about its effects - led to the elimination of "wild polio" transmission in the country and became a model in the ongoing world eradication campaign. Nigeria - Africa's most populous country - which once accounted for more than half of all global cases - was the last African country to be declared free of the crippling disease. (Wild polio, which continues to be transmitted in Pakistan and Afghanistan, is distinct from the rare cases resulting from use of live-virus vaccines in places where vaccine coverage and sanitation are poor.) Dr Maria Guevara, International Medical Secretary of Médecins Sans Frontières /Doctors Without Borders, welcomed the appointment. "GAVI and its new CEO must... prioritise access to catch-up vaccinations everywhere, especially in humanitarian emergencies, for zero-dose and under-immunised children, covering those over the age of one as well," the organisation said in a press release.
