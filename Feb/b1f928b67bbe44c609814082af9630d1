Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki spoke recently on the two-year war in the Northern Tigray region between Ethiopian and Tigrayan forces. He said that the peace deal that ended the war - signed in Pretoria, South Africa on November 2, 2022 - was brokered by the U.S., to save the Tigrayan forces from losing on the battlefield. This comes as Eritrea's invasion of Ethiopia's Tigray regional state, and its role in the war was marked with reports of extreme atrocities, which both Ethiopia and Eritrea initially denied. However, in May 2021, Ethiopia admitted the involvement of Eritrean troops in atrocities against civilians, confirming several reports by media and human rights organisations, including the state-backed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, which reported "grave human rights violations and an attack against civilians in Axum city, Tigray region." The war between Ethiopia and Tigray began on November 3, 2020 and ended on November 2, 2022.
