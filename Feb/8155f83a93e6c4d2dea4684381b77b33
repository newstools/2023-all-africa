The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) director Martha Chizuma is back in office after the High Court in Blantyre suspended an interdiction order government issued against her. Chizuma was interdicted for a leaked audio in which she discussed an ongoing corruption investigation with a third-party, is at liberty to return to her duties. Following the decision by the court, the U.S. Embassy has issued a statement condemning the "two months of harassment by the government officials" against Chizuma. "Since then, no one who carried out or authorized the arrest has been held to account. Following the arrest, the government established a Commission of Inquiry that not only produced an unbalanced report but also did not address the violations of the Director General's fundamental human rights," the U.S.Embassy said. Chizuma is the first woman to head the anti-graft body, and was appointed in May 2021.
