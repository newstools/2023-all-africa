Nigeria's election commission published results for one of 36 states on the evening of Sunday Febuary 26, 2023, as the country's delayed general election started drawing to a close. The process was adjourned to Monday. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) began collating election results on Sunday, even as voting continued in some constitutencies which had suffered delays or disruptions on election day (Saturday). A coaltion of civic groups appealed for INEC to maintain neutralility and transparency, for police to maintain order and for citizens to remain peaceful as vote counting proceeds. INEC issued a statement expressing "regret" for the "relatively slow and unsteady" performace of the portal used for management of the results process. The statement said the problem was caused by "technocal glitches" and was not "due to any intrusion or sabotage." Premium Times reports that observers deployed by the publication and the Center for Journalism Innovation Development and other civil society groups across Nigeria's 36 States "observed that the poor conduct of INEC officials and ad-hoc staff across polling units contributed to low turnout of voters across in the country".
