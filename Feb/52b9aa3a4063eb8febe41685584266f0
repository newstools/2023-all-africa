Presidential candidate Bola Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Atiku Abubakar from the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi from the Labour Party (LP), are locked in a tight race, as results of the February 25, 2023 elections trickle in. Tinubu has established an early lead from results announced so far, followed by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and Peter Obi. However, there is apprehension that it might be difficult for any of the three candidates to get a simple majority and 25% of the votes scored in at least two-thirds (24) of Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja - to be declared outright winner, reports Vanguard. Meanwhile, former president Olusegun Obasanjo has urged the country's electoral body to save the country from "a looming danger" over what he described as corruption of the electoral process. He said INEC's decision to revert to the manual transmission of results was deliberate, despite investing in an electronic system that would allow immediate transmission of results from polling units. The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party have claimed there is a lack of transparency with the new electronic voting system and staged a walkout at the National Collation Centre in Abuja. INEC's chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu has assured the Nigerian people that the process of collation and announcement would be transparent, even as INEC has explained that the challenges the commission was encountering with the transmission of results were not due to sabotage of its system.
