New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the British government of lying, and the British and American governments of committing "crimes against humanity" in the process of establishing a strategically important U.S. military base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, writes John Allen for AllAfrica. The accusations, made in a 106-page report issued on Wednesday February 15 2023, arise from the forced expulsion, in the 1960s and 1970s, of the residents of the Chagos archipelago.
