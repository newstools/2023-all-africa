President Muhammadu Buhari has made a special appeal for the United Arab Emirates to lift a visa ban placed on Nigerian visitors. Buhari made the request in a telephone conversation with Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE.  In his request, President Buhari recalled the mutually beneficial, excellent relations between the two nations over many years, symbolised by robust economic interactions and regular consultations on matters of common interest, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson said. The Nigerian leader admitted that some Nigerians may be violating the laws of the UAE but said that was not enough to impose a blanket ban. He said no country including Nigeria will condone criminalities and illegal behaviours. In 2022, UAE banned citizens from 20 African countries including Nigeria from being issued visas, without giving a reason. Buhari also requested that Emirates Airlines resume flights to Nigeria. Emirates suspended its Nigerian flights in 2022 after difficulties in repatriating its dollar profits. Buhari said he's directed the central bank to increase dollar allocations to Emirates and other airlines facing similar challenges.
