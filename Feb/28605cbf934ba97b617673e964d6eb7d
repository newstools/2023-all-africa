Cybastion is "a diaspora-owned small business" that United States President Joe Biden cited during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December for joining with Cisco on contracts "to protect African countries from cyber threats". Cybersecurity must have a central role as Africa embraces the digital revolution, the company's CEO, Dr. Thierry Wandji, said in an interview. African governments are increasingly committed to data protection "because they recognize the urgency" and welcome the employment that the sector can generate.
