Equatorial Guinea has confirmed its first-ever outbreak of Marburg virus disease after positive tests, following the deaths of at least nine people in the country's western Kie Ntem province. The presence of the viral haemorrhagic fever has seen the health ministry deploy advanced teams in the affected districts to trace contacts, isolate and provide medical care to people showing symptoms of the disease. Marburg virus disease is a highly virulent disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, with a fatality ratio of up to 88%. Patients can experience high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Many develop severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days. The virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces, and materials. The World Health Organisation is meanwhile deploying health emergency experts in epidemiology, case management, infection prevention, laboratory and risk communication to support the national response efforts and secure community collaboration in the outbreak control.
