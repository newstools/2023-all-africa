As expected, the conference on the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA), organised by the AU-IGAD-UNITAMS Trilateral Mechanism in coordination with the signatories to the Framework Agreement, was launched in the South Sudanese capital on January 31, 2023. But the displaced community leaders in Darfur are reported to have told Radio Dabanga that their invites were cancelled at the last minute, meanwhile, some community leaders were not invited at all. Displaced women leader Awatif Abdelrahman said that at the request of the Centre for Peace Studies in Nyala, they nominated three women to represent the South Darfur displaced women, but the invitation was cancelled a day before the launch of the conference.Â  Yagoub Furi, head of the Darfur Displaced and Refugee Camps Coordination said the conference may fail due to not inviting the real stakeholders. He said they consider the lack of an invitation a belittling of their status.  On December 5, 2022, the Sudan military concluded a framework agreement with dozens of civilian leaders, in which the generals promised to relinquish much of their political power. The agreement, which has been under quiet discussion for months, is a major accomplishment, but it faces long odds. It excludes former rebels and others who could undermine the transitional government if not brought on board.
