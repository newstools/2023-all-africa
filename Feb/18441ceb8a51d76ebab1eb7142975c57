A few days to the presidential election, candidates are still crisscrossing the country demanding Nigerians' votes through open and media campaigns, and even engaging in local debates and international dialogues - including the signing a peace accord with the National Peace Committee, writes Olalekan A. Babatunde for Daily Trust.  Nigerians are getting ready to vote for a new president on February 25, with eighteen presidential candidates vying for the top job. The candidates all agree on the importance of creating jobs, fighting corruption, and improving security. However, the candidates have yet to impress on how they will address the security challenges they are about to inherit and promote sustainable peace, writes Babatunde. Whoever wins, the next Nigerian president faces a daunting task that ranges from security and financial problems, including Boko Haram violence and banditry in many parts of the country, high unemployment and worsening economic, and systemic corruption that deters investment, on top of the cash shortages.
