Several leaders of African nations have expressed their condolences and solidarity with Turkey and Syria after a massive earthquake. At least 4,800 people were killed and thousands more injured after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake. The World Health Organisation has warned that the death toll will likely increase as much as eight times, as rescuers find more victims in the rubble.
