Award-winning actor and comedian Kevin Hart had been due to perform in Cairo on February 21, but the show was cancelled because of "local logistics issues". However, many believe that a statement Hart made in the past was the reason for the show's cancellation. He reportedly referred to ancient Egyptians as Black people. "We must teach our children the true history of Black Africans when they were kings in Egypt and not just the era of slavery that is cemented by education in America. Do you remember the time when we were kings?"  The statement sparked an uproar, reports Melody Chironda for allAfrica.
