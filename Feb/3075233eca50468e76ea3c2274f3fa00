The leader of the Ennahdha movement, Rached Ghannouchi has been summoned by the Aouina National Guard's Counter-Terrorism Unit, in what the party's spokesperson Imed Khemiri considers a "trumped-up case." Khemiri said the objective of the latest summons is to exert pressure on Ennahdha, as part of a broader security campaign against politicians, journalists, and businesspersons. He noted that the arrests of political leaders who oppose the "July 25 coup" are part of a broader campaign aimed at quashing dissenting voices. While Amnesty International has condemned the Tunisian authorities' actions, President Kais Saied has branded those arrested as "terrorists" and accused them of conspiring to undermine the state and manipulate food prices, to foment social tension.
