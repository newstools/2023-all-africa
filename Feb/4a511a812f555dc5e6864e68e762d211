At least 14,000 Nigerian residents from the oil-producing Niger Delta region have filed a compensation claim against Shell, saying that oil spills resulting from the oil giant's operations have destroyed farms, contaminated drinking water, and harmed aquatic life. The case follows a ruling by the UK's Supreme Court in 2021 that denied the Nigerians' application to sue Shell in the UK - but ruled that there was a "good arguable case" that the company's parent could owe the communities a duty of care and be legally responsible for the pollution at the heart of the case. Shell argued that the case should be heard by courts in Nigeria. Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, said: "Had this level of contamination and pollution occurred in Europe or North America, it is hard to imagine that there would not have been swift and severe consequences and legal redress. Shell should clean up the pollution the oil has caused in these communities and compensate those whose livelihoods have been devastated and whose health has been harmed." Shell said in 2021 that it plans to leave the Niger Delta and sell its onshore oilfields and assets after 80 years of operations. In December 2022, Shell agreed to pay U.S.$16 million to four Nigerian farmers and their communities to compensate for damage allegedly caused by pollution caused by leaks in its oil pipelines.
