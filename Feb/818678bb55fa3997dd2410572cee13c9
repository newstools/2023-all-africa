The Federal Executive Council has approved a contract for an electronic cargo tracking device that will monitor all vessels entering and leaving Nigerian waters. Transport Minister Mu'azu Jaji Sambo said that the device will help curb recurring incidents of oil theft along the Nigerian maritime water. The device is expected to tackle under-declaration at ports, secure imports and exports, as well as provide transparency in cargo invoicing and declarations. According to the minister, the facility will be deployed by a consortium of five companies made up of a foreign technical partner and four local companies. The scheme is expected to generate revenue for the government ranging from about U.S.$90 million per annum to a peak of about U.S.$235m per annum. Sambo also said that the state-of-the-art scheme has been in use in not less than 26 African countries, including Ghana, Benin Republic, Togo, and Senegal.
