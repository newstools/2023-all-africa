Zanzibar President Hussein Mwinyi has banned exports of all food commodities as an immediate measure to curb shortages and price hikes. The president instructed traders to release food they have stored in warehouses in order to curb shortages and the increasing prices while promising that his government will ensure that food prices continue to drop. Deputy Minister for Investment, Industry and Trade, Exaud Kigahe said the trend in price hikes indicates that some products' prices have increased as a result of the fall in production during the 2021/2022 farming season. Maize, maize flour, rice, beans, potatoes, wheat flour, sugar, and cooking oil are some food items whose prices have increased. Kigahe added that the produces have been affected by the shortage of rain during the agricultural season.
