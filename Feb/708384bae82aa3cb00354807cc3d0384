The East African Community (EAC) Summit hosted by has ordered the immediate withdrawal of foreign armed groups in Eastern DRC as part of renewed efforts to end clashes in the region, Jeremiah Wakaya reports for Capital FM. The directive was listed in a communique released at the end of the 20th Extra-Ordinary Summit hosted by Burundi's President Évariste Ndayishimiye on Saturday, February 4, 2023. Deutsche Welle  previously reported that Eastern European military personnel are staying at a hotel near the airport of Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi has consistently denied the presence of Wagner Group mercenaries in his country's territory. The Wagner Group is seen as Russia's "shadow army". Strained relations between DR Congo and Rwanda flared up in recent months, following what Tshesekdi says is Rwanda's President Paul Kagame's support of M23 militants who are operating in DR Congo. Despite denials by Rwanda, the frosty relations has worsened. In the past month, Rwanda military fired at DR Congo military jets, which it said violated its airspace.
