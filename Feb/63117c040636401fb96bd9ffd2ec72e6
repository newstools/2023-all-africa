Special envoys from the European Union, Britain, France, Germany, Norway, and the U.S. have vowed to support Sudan's transition to a civilian-led government. The six envoys arrived in Khartoum on February 8, 2023 and met with Sudanese political leaders to show support for the country's ongoing political transition. But they agreed to resume financial support to Sudan only once a civilian-led transitional government is formed. The envoys' visit coincided with an official visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Khartoum, as part of his African tour to strengthen economic and political ties. Sudanese political analyst Haj Hamed said Russia was trying to send a signal to western countries that it also has strong ties with Sudan, and that it has to protect its interests. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Sudan's Transitional Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has affirmed his commitment to the Framework Agreement and his cooperation with all involved parties. The junta leader also called for his opponents to reach a comprehensive final agreement, to pave the way for a transitional government with civilian leadership leading the country to free and fair elections, by the end of the transitional period.
