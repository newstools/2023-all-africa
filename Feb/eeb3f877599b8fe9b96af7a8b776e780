The life-threatening disease noma is one step closer to being recognised as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) after the international medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) supported Nigeria's request to the World Health Organization (WHO) to add it to its list of NTDs. Noma is yet to be classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). Experts believe that the inclusion of noma disease in the WHO list of NTDs will bring the required attention to the disease including funding for research. WHO defines noma as a necrotising or flesh-eating disease that typically affects children between the ages of two to six. Its root causes remain unknown, however, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, failed immunisation, and other social factors, such as poverty have been identified as contributing factors. Mostly it affects people in isolated communities who have limited access to healthcare and vaccinations. It starts as an inflammation of the gums but spreads rapidly, destroying facial tissues and bones. If left untreated, up to 90% of people affected will die, usually within a short time. Those who survive are left with a severe facial disfigurement that can make it hard to eat, speak, see, or breathe. The WHO will take the final decision on whether to add noma to its list of neglected tropical diseases during one of its biannual meetings in 2023.
