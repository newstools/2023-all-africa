President Kais Saied, while chairing a national security council meeting in Carthage on February 21, 2023 emphasised the need for immediate action "to halt the influx of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa to Tunisia. The president said: "this situation is highly abnormal, with the continued influx of these migrants resulting in an increase in crime, violence, and other reprehensible practices. It is unacceptable and requires immediate intervention to restore order and security to the region". In Morocco, where African migrants enjoy full social rights and are integrated into the Kingdom's social fabric, these remarks have caused immense consternation, writes Maghreb Arab Presse.
