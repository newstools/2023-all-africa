A head-on collision between a bus and a cash-in-transit van has left almost 20 tourists dead and dozens injured in Limpopo province. ER24, an emergency response service, reports that the bus rolled off a bridge into a river, landing on its side. "Three people were found deceased by the roadside and sixteen down by the river. Most of the fatalities down by the river had been trapped under the bus," said ER24 spokeperson Ross Campbell. He added that several passengers are still unaccounted for. Heavy rains have fallen in the Limpopo province this week and the regionalÂ transport department said police divers are searching a river that runs along the highway, for those who might have been swept away. Limpopo Transport spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene says the cause of the accident is under investigation.
