Mental health is influenced by a range of factor that include trauma, poverty and even air quality, but despite mental health issues being so pervasive in many African countries, it seldom gets the attention it deserves. Nigeria's President Buhari has finally signed into law the Mental Health Bill 2021 after two failed attempts at overhaul in 2003 and 2013. A statement by Nigeria Mental Health and others working in the sector say the bill "establishes human rights protections for those with mental health conditions, such as banning discrimination in housing, employment, medical, and other social services. "It also guarantees that those receiving treatments have the right to participate in formulating their medical plans and cannot have forced treatment, seclusion, or other methods of restraint - common practices in mental health facilities - without appropriate safeguards."
