The Govenor of Nigeria's Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele has been accused of making funds available to terrorist groups operating in the country. Justice Hassan of a High Court in Abuja has thus far restrained the State Security Service (SSS) from arresting the governor on those charges, Premium Times reports. The judge said that the SSS, "acted wrongfully and illegally in instigating President Muhammadu Buhari against Mr. Godwin Emefiele in respect of the exercise of his statutory duty relating to the issuance of monetary policies and directives in the interest of the National Security and economy."  The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders' Forum (SMBLF) has also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to put his house in order and save the country from, "repeated, unwarranted national embarrassments." The SMBLF led by Chief Edwin Clark, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Dr. Pogu Bitrus and Ambassador Okey Emuchay, called the actions against Emefiele "disgraceful", write Sunday Aborisade and Emameh Gabriel for This Day.
