Tanzania opposition leader Tundu Lissu has returned to the country from self-imposed exile in Belgium, where he had lived since surviving an assassination attempt in 2017 when he was shot 16 times. Lissu was welcomed by hundreds of supporters, with many clapping and cheering upon his arrival at Dar es Salaam airport on Wednesday, January 25, 2023 While living abroad, Lissu was a presidential candidate in the 2020 general election but lost to the late President John Magufuli. His Chadema party rejected the official results, saying the election was tainted with widespread irregularities. Lissu left Tanzania after losing the election saying he feared for his life after he was briefly detained by police when he called for a national protest. Lissu's return comes weeks after Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan lifted a ban on political rallies that were imposed by former president Magufuli in 2016, the ban prohibited political parties from holding rallies and engaging in internal political activities.
