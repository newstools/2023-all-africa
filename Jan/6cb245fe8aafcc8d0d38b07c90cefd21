Human rights groups have expressed concern over escalating cases of politically-motivated violence against villagers aligned to opposition parties ahead of the 2023 general elections. Responding to a viral social media video showing brutal attacks against supporters of the political opposition party Citizens' Coalition for Change, Flavia Mwangovya, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for East and Southern Africa, said: "This callous, politically motivated attack against older people who had simply attended a gathering for a political opposition party is outrageous. Such cruel acts of violence, which have repeatedly marred Zimbabwe's political landscape in the past, gravely threaten the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly". The video, which appears to have been filmed by one of the assailants, shows a group of apparent supporters of the country's ruling ZANU-PF party kicking and beating with sticks older people in in Murehwa North, a rural district of Marondera East. The ruling party has distanced itself from the individuals in the political violence Zimbabwe has a long history of violence in the run-up to elections, with opposition parties repeatedly accusing ZANU-PF of being behind the attacks. Amnesty has previously documented similar election-related human rights violations in the country. During the 2008 elections, more than 200 people were killed during and after the election amid violence against opposition supporters.
