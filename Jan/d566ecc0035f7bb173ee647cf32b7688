The race to replace Morocco is now more open than ever as of the eight teams present in the quarter-finals in the last edition, none qualified this time for the second round.           All eyes will be on the Baraki stadium in Algiers where the Fennecs will meet the Elephants of CÃ´te d'Ivoire for the first quarter-final. The local Elephants started with a defeat against Senegal (0-1), then a draw against DR Congo (0-0), before beating Uganda (3-1) on the last day, suddenly snatching an almost unexpected qualification.           Algeria is therefore advancing with more certainty especially with its defensive solidity. Moreover, it will be able to count on the 40,000 supporters of Baraki's Nelson-Mandela stadium which is expected to fill up.           Mauritania, for its part, celebrated its first quarter-final qualification at CHAN, after two unsuccessful attempts. Led by their new coach, the Comorian Amir Abou, also responsible for the 'A' team, do not want to stop there after eliminating previous finalist, Mali.           Finally, the last quarter-final between Madagascar and Mozambique will see two outsiders who thwarted the predictions in the first round. The Malagasy got this far by beating Ghana (2-1) and Sudan (3-0). The Mozambicans managed to finish behind Algeria after beating Libya, titled in 2014.
