U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen is meeting with South African Minister of Finance Enoch Godongwana, making this the first bilateral meeting between representatives of the two portfolios in 7 years. The two officials had "fruitful" discussions, which included money laundering, the countering of the financing of terrorism, climate financing and sovereign debt resolution in Africa.           Ahead of her meeting with Godongwana, Yellen announced plans to form a task force that will combat the financing of wildlife trafficking. The task force will combat illicit finance linked to illegal wildlife trade.           Yellen's visit to South Africa is the third leg of her tour of Africa, having already visited Zambia and Senegal. The Treasury official's dimplomatic trip comes amid similar missions by officials from China and Russia.
