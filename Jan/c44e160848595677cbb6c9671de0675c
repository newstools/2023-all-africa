Eskom has welcomed an 18.65% tariff increase granted by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa, saying it would "positively contribute from a financial and sustainability point of view". This comes ahead of a statement by Western Cape Premier Alan Winde who said that it was "another blow" for South Africans who will be charged more for services they will not be getting.           Eskom approached the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) and initially sought an increase of 32%, citing higher costs for fuel, decreased generation capacity higher prices from independent power producers. The electricity price hike is expected to take effect from April 1, 2023, with an additional 12.74% tariff increase set for 2024. As of January 13, 2023, Stage 4 blackouts have been scheduled daily from 5am until 4pm while Stage 6 load shedding will be implemented afterwards between 4pm and 5am.
