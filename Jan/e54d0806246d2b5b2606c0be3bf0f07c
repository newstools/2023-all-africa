South Sudan's national security service has detained six journalists who work for the country's national broadcaster, SSBC, the country's press union said.           Patrick Oyet, who heads the Union of Journalists of South Sudan, said five journalists were detained Tuesday and one on Wednesday, according to Manyang David Mayar writing for Voice of America.           The arrest appears to be connected to a video of President Salva Kiir, according to Oyet and media rights groups.           The footage, shared widely on social media in December, appeared to show Kiir urinate on himself while at an official engagement, according to The Associated Press. The video quickly cuts away from the shots of the 71-year-old president, the AP reported.
