Intelligence organs have arrested a man in Salaama, a Kampala suburb suspected to be an agent of Allied Democratic Forces and a suicide bomb maker. According to Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson, Patrick Onyango, Kayemba is believed to be a suicide bomber for the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militant group and that his home was the laboratory where improvised explosive devices were being made. The bomb squad and counter-terrorism units of the police, together with their Forensic directorate, searched Kayemba's house for any material evidence. The house didn't have any home appliances but instead items including those commonly found in laboratories. Officials found several things at the house including an AK47 rifle, two locally made pistols, a bag of falcon pellets, jerricans of hydrogen peroxide solution, sulfuric acid, lead nitrate, and several powders that security said are ingredients in the making of improvised explosive devices. Since 2021 when twin bombings happened in Kampala, Ugandan security launched a manhunt targeting ADF sleeper cells in the country and a group targeting security personnel including police stations. Several suspects have been arrested in the process.
