On 5 December 2022, the Sudan military concluded a framework agreement with dozens of civilian leaders, in which the generals promised to relinquish much of their political power. The agreement, which has been under quiet discussion for months, is a major accomplishment, but it faces long odds. It excludes former rebels and others who could undermine the transitional government if not brought on board.           Many of those who are against the agreement, including the "resistance committees" at the core of the protest movement demanding civilian rule, doubt that the generals will honour the deal's terms.
