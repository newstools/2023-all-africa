The latest report by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation on African governance, rates the continent as less secure than it was a decade ago. Africa is considered more vulnerable to the effects of the war in Ukraine. "Africa's overall governance score has flatlined since 2019, and in 2021 much of Africa is less safe, secure and democratic than in 2012," according to the 2022 Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). The report ranks Mauritius first in the Overall Governance category, with its Indian Ocean neighbour, Seychelles, second. Tunisia, Cape Verde, Botswana, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia, Senegal and Morocco follow. Somalia, Eritrea and South Sudan are ranked last, Benita Van Eyssen writes for Deutsche Welle.
