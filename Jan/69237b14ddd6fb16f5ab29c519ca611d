Hospital admissions of children suffering from severe malnutrition have spiked in Dagahaley, one of three refugee camps in the Dadaab refugee complex, amid worsening humanitarian conditions in the overcrowded camps, according to the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Several factors are aggravating the humanitarian situation in Dagahaley, and stretching the healthcare capacity in the camp. These include an ongoing cholera outbreak, declared at the end of October 2022, a crippling drought and prolonged conflict that continue to displace people in the Horn of Africa.
