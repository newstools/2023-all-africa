The Chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu has said INEC is satisfied with the preparations done so far ahead of the elections. Yakubu was speaking at an event organized by the Chatham House in London. Earlier this month, INEC warned that the election risked postponement or disruption if security was not addressed. The government says measures are in place to guarantee the vote. Nigeria's elections in the past have been marred by logistical delays, violence, and claims of fraud and vote buying. Since 2019, INEC facilities across the country have been attacked over 50 times and its officials and security personnel injured and killed in some cases, said Yakubu. Yakubu also explained why Nigerians in the diaspora cannot vote in the upcoming February 2023 elections. He said although the electoral body subscribes to it, the Nigerian law makes it impossible for such a category of citizens to vote in the nation's elections. Yakubu also stressed that INEC is prepared to conduct the run-off in the event that no winner emerges after the polls. Nigerians are set to elect a new president at the end of February, then will elect governors and local councils two weeks after.
