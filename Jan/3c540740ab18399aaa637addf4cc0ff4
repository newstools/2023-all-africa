Despite the government's commitment to promoting press freedom and the freedom of expression, the continued harassment of journalists and the muzzling of critics tells a different story. Following incidents of journalists being obstructed in their work and a lawyer being attacked in Zimbabwe, media and lawyers' associations are demanding that police respect their rights. This comes after police escorted 25 members of the Citizens Coalition for Change opposition party to a magistrate's court in Harare, where some journalists were blocked from the courtroom. Journalists from two state-run media houses were reportedly permitted to cover the court hearing but others were turned away.
