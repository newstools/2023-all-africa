Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu has lifted a six-year-old ban on political rallies. On June 24, 2016 late president John Magufuli announced a blanket ban on political parties organising political activities and rallies. The ban was intended to end when the election period started in 2020, but continued when Suluhu took office. Some opposition politicians say the president's move should be a foundation stone for democracy in the country. "Though the ban should never have been made in the first place, we applaud the Tanzanian government's decision to lift the blanket ban on political rallies in the country that has in the past been used to arbitrarily arrest and detain prominent opposition politicians who organised rallies," said Roland Ebole, Amnesty International's regional researcher for Tanzania and Uganda.
