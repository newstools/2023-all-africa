The conflict between Ethiopia and Tigray region escalated into a full-scale war in November 2020. Millions of people were displaced and fled to neighbouring countries such as Sudan. Attempts at an AU-led peaceful resolution were made, with the latest peace talks held in South Africa in October 2022 and which ended in a peace deal on November 3, 2022. The first official visit by Ethiopian officials was made to Tigray region at the end of December 2022. Latest reports from the Tigray region indicate that there is a shortage of medical supplies to its biggest hospital - Ayder Comprehensive Referral hospital - where life-saving procedures have been put on hold until supplies are delivered, writes Addis Standard.   Oromia State is a regional state in Ethiopia and the homeland of the Oromo people. Oromia was attacked on November 25 and 29, 2022 in the Kiremu and Gida Ayana districts in the East Wollega Zone. The attacks were blamed on "Fano militia" from the neighbouring Amhara region. Dozens of people were killed and thousands were displaced, Addis Standard reported. The latest update on Oromia is that the Ethiopian National Defense Forces announced a renewed military operation against the Oromo Liberation Army in southern Oromia. The defense forces said it is aiming to destroy the rebel group operating in the area and stabilise the region. The army also said it has liberated several villages in southern Oromia, Addis Standard reports. This comes as the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission revealed in a report in May 2022 that illegal detentions were rampant in Oromia region - in police stations, irregular prisons, military training camps, or military bases. The report highlighted the prisoners, especially those who are in the leadership of the Oromo Liberation Front, were arrested without due process of law.
