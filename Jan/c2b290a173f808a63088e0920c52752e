Genital mutilation, or as amended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), genital modification, is common in Southern and East Africa. Dark recounts of how some churches have adopted the lengthening of the labia minora into their doctrines and the constant, physical checking of minors' private parts, were shared with NewZimbabwe.com during the course of compiling their report. The labia minora are the soft inner tissues or lips of the vagina which extend outwards from the clitoris. Sithabile Nkomo, who revealed how she had to endure years of being forced by her church and family to lengthen her labia, before standing her ground, was told a long labia would translate to a healthy marriage. She was told her husband would not dare leave her as long as her labia was lengthened.
