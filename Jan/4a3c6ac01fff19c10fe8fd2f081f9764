Europe's controversial Global Gateway Plan can complement existing development projects - in a direct response to China's Belt and Road initiative in Africa, writes Teniola Tayo for the Institute for Security Studies. The European Union (EU) will, on Febuary 6, 2023 finalise the list of priority projects under its initiative. The plan is to mobilise investments that build sustainable links worldwide that was unveiled in December 2021. Half of the €300 billion global target is earmarked for soft and hard infrastructure projects in Africa between 2021 and 2027. The Lake Chad Basin has been ravaged by Boko Haram violence for over a decade, and the global gateway could help resolve the underlying causes of the crisis.
