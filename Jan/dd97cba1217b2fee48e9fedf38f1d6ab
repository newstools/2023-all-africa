About 38 million people around the world are living with HIV. About 70% of them live in Africa. In 2021, there were 1.5 million new cases of HIV - just over 4,000 cases per day around the world. At the same time, close to 700,000 people died. In 2016, countries came together at the United Nations to agree on ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. Scientist Professor Salim Abdool Karim, Director of the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) points out three things the health sector needs to do to reach the 2030 goal. Firstly, he said they should appreciate that everyone is mutually interdependent: each person's risk affects the risk faced by others. "Hence, we need solutions that involve everyone working towards a common purpose," Karim said. Secondly, it would be to mobilise the resources to at least get treatment up to the targets set, and thirdly to strengthen the work on prevention.
