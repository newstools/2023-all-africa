In the latest development arising from the fallout between Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi and his predecessor, a magistrate has issued a warrant for the arrest of former president Ian Khama. The warrant was issued after Khama, who left Botswana in November 2021, failed to appear in court on charges that include the illegal possession of firearms.           Khama and Masisi fell out in 2019 after Masisi - who had served as Khama's vice-president - succeeded him as president at the end of his 10-year term in 2018. Khama left the Botswana Democratic Party - which has ruled the country since his father, Sir Seretse Khama, led the country to independence in 1966 - and campaigned for the opposition in the 2019 elections.
