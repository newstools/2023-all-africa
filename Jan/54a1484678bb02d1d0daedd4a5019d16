Lack of media reforms will likely impact the coverage of 2023 elections as most of the recommendations by the European Union (EU) and African Union Observer Mission (AU-EOM) from previous plebiscites are yet to be implemented. As part of its assessment of Zimbabwe's media space ahead of the 2023 elections, a report by the Democratic Governance and Rights Unit (DGRU) revealed that failure to implement media-related reforms will hinder free and fair coverage of the upcoming polls. Despite the government's commitment to promoting press freedom and freedom of expression, the continued harassment of journalists and the muzzling of critics tell a different story. Zimbabwe's main political parties have started preparing for the country's general elections in 2023 as they hold rallies and campaign activities in cities and towns to whip up their support bases.The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has yet to announce the exact date for the vote, but it has revealed that it would be held in either July or August 2023.
