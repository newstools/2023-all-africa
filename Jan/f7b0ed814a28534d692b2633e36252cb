The Nigerian Ports Authority has said that the first commercial vessel has berthed at the Lekki Deep Sea Port. This came ahead of President Muhammadu Buhari's inauguration of the U.S.$1.5 billion Lekki Deep Sea Port. The Lekki Deep Seaport is a state-of-the-art facility that is the largest seaport and one of the biggest in West Africa that would revolutionise the way goods are transported and traded in Nigeria.  The new facility is expected to generate direct and induced business revenue estimated at U.S.$158 billion, a qualitative impact on the manufacturing, commercial and services sectors, and a multiplier effect over 230 times the cost of construction. It will attract a massive influx of people, businesses, and investment, according to The Conversation.
