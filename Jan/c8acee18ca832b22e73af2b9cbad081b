A joint study by the United Nations, Somalia's health ministry and the country's national university found that mental health conditions are prevalent across the country. It said that cases are about 77% higher than a previous study by the World Health Organization (WHO), which suggested that nearly 40% of the population in Somalia had a mental or psychological disorder.           Another discovery of the study is the high degree of prevalence of substance abuse among the young population - the most affected by mental health illnesses - who are turning to drug abuse.           Abdi Ismail Samatar of The Conversation Africa writes that, there are two main forces responsible for the catastrophe that is Somalia. The dominant faction of the Somali political class is the chief culprit. Their agenda has been to attain power and loot the country's resources for private gain. Second is the international community, who are the junior partners of the political class. Based on my observations, representatives of western and African governments fear that Somalia could become a base for "terrorists", which might destabilise the strategic Horn of Africa. But they are unwilling to engage with civic and independent-minded Somalis. Meanwhile, the military said last December it liberated the last town held by Al-Shabaab militants in the Middle Shabelle region, killing more than 150 fighters, including five foreigners. It was the second major town that the army says it liberated from the Islamist militant group in less than a month.
