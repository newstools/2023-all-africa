Hundreds of industrial workers in Harare's busy Workington area have been laid off by different companies struggling to operate due to an electricity crisis that has seen the area going almost a month without power. Companies have reduced their workforce to cut down on wage bills. They have been using generators since December 28, 2022 when one of power utility ZESA's sub-power stations blew up. Zimbabweans have daily power outages because there is not enough water in the Kariba dam to operate the country's primary hydropower plant. Kariba's waterÂ level has been decreasing steadily because of drought and low inflows from the Zambezi River and its tributaries. Critics have been harsh on how the government has dealt with the energy crisis, and senior Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority officials have been accused of corruption and bad corporate governance. Meanwhile, experts say power generation is being crippled by a lack of investment in renewable energy.
