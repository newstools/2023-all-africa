Sudan's military and civilian leaders have spent three days in talks with the aim of reaching a final deal on governing during a two-year transition to elections. Sudan's ruling military has vowed the army will come under civilian authority. The spokesman for the civilian side, Khalid Omer Yousif said this is an opportunity for all Sudanese to engage and cooperate with the regional and international community to achieve the high national interests of the country. Sudan's army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan gave no details on when the military would step aside but said it would keep its word to leave politics. Al-Burhan overthrew a transitional, civilian government led by former Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok in October 2021, citing a lack of attention to alleged threats. The coup came just weeks before the military was to hand power to civilian authorities, sparking international condemnation and a withdrawal of foreign aid.
