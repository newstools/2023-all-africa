Frene Ginwala has passed away at the age of 90. According to a statement by South Africa's parliament, the country has "lost one of the foremost iconic leaders of our struggle for liberation, one of the pre-eminent midwives to our constitutional democracy and founding Speaker in our democratic Parliament". While Shireen Hasim for The Conversation Africa, recalls her as a "feisty feminist, astute political tactician and committed cadre of South Africa's governing African National Congress. "In a country blessed with exceptional leaders, Ginwala must surely count among the best". "Typically for her, but unusually for the ANC leadership, she will be laid to rest in a private ceremony. While she was modest about her achievements, she has left an indelible mark on South Africa's Constitution and democratic institutions".
