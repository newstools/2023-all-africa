Many children of immigrant parents who are undocumented are struggling to get places in South African schools, writes Kimberly Mutandiro for GroundUp. As a result, many have had to resort to begging at traffic lights instead of attending classes. This development comes after a landmark decision by the Makhanda High Court in 2019 determined that Clauses 15 and 21 of the school Admission Policy for Ordinary Public Schools of 1998 were unconstitutional and that learners without birth certificates should not be barred from receiving basic schooling.           The online school registration placement system requires documentation and most public schools insist on it. Private schools will accept undocumented children but the fees are too high for most parents.
