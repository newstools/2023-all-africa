Cameroonian government officials have denied Canada's foreign ministry's announcement that Cameroon and some separatist factions have agreed to a peace process, with Ottawa assigned to help. The officials said that no such role was mandated.           Cameroon government spokesperson René Emmanuel Sadi said Yaoundé never entrusted any country with the role of facilitator or mediator with separatists in its western regions.           The denial of Canada's mediation deflated hopes for talks to end seven years of fighting that has left thousands of people dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced.           Switzerland has also made attempts to mediate the conflict, but with little progress. Canada says the conflict has killed more than 6,000 people since 2017, displaced 800,000, and deprived 600,000 children of access to education.           The groups have said on social media, that only armed conflict would free the people of Ambazonia, an English-speaking state they are fighting to carve out from French-speaking majority in Cameroon.
