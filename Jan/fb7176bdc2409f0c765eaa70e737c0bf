On December 10, 2022, the world lost one of the most dedicated, vibrant women working to strengthen U.S.-Africa relations and to advance human rights and economic development for the African people. Patricia Baine, known to her friends and family as Gudy, was only 45 years of age when she passed away. Many individuals have expressed the desire to assist her family and show their love for Patricia and all she stood for. To this end, the Africa Society has established the Africa Society Patricia Baine Memorial Fund which would be a tangible way to show her family how highly regarded Patricia was among her many friends and colleagues and to express our gratitude for her achievements and tireless life of service.
