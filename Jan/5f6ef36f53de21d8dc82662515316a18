While President Macky Sall is quiet on whether he will throw his hat in the ring for a third presidential term in the 2024 elections. The country's former prime minister Aminata Toure who served from September 1, 2013 to July 4, 2014 - has said she will keep fighting against a possible third term for her former boss. Toure was stripped of her seat in parliament this week - a move she says is based solely on her decision to oppose Sall's possible candidacy.
