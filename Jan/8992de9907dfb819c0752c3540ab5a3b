Five suspects have been arraigned in court for the murder of Edwin Chiloba, Juma Majanga of Voice of America reports. The LGBTQI+ activist was found dead on a roadside and stuffed in a metal trunk, sparking outrage across the nation.           Among the five suspects arraigned is Jacktone Odhiambo, a freelance photographer said to be a longtime friend of 25-year-old Chiloba. Kenyan police noted that a possible love triangle may have been a motive for the killing.           Chiloba was a prominent fashion model and advocate for LGBTQI+ rights. Reacting to reports on his murder, the Kenya Human Rights Commission said the escalation of violence against the LGBTQI+ community is worrisome.
