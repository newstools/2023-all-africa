Rwanda has set up an emergency refugee camp in Rubavu District in anticipation of a possible influx of refugees in the coming weeks amid fears of renewed fighting in eastern DR Congo between government forces and the M23 rebels. Nkamira Transit Centre was opened on January 16 and there were 670 Congolese refugees as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Nearly 3,000 Congolese refugees have arrived in Rwanda since November 2022, 1,760 have been taken to Mahama refugee camp in Kirehe District in Eastern Province. At the centre government and aid agencies have already connected water supply channels, electricity and a health facility. Several site operators and staff from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organisations are on the site. Most refugees come from North Kivu province where developments in the past week have raised red flags about the intentions of the Congolese government and military, and their sincerity in sticking to the roadmap agreed in Luanda. There are fears of renewed fighting between the M23 rebels and the coalition including the Congolese army and armed militia groups such as the FDLR, a militia from Rwanda.
