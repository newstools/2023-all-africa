Berlin's museum authority has announced that it was ready to return hundreds of human skulls from the former colony of German East Africa, after studying the remains to establish to which present-day countries they belong, writes Radio France Internationale.           German East Africa, established in the 1880s and broken up after the end of World War I in 1918, included present-day Burundi, Rwanda, mainland Tanzania and part of Mozambique.           In recent years some European nations that played key roles in colonial crimes and have hesitantly tendered an apology for their actions, wrote Isaac Kaledzi for Deutsche Welle. In 2022, Germany agreed to pay Namibia â‚¬1.1 billion (U.S.$1.3 billion) in reparation for genocide committed during its colonial-era occupation of the country.
