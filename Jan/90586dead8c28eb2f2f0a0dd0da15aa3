Messages of condolences have been streaming in for human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko, who was murdered outside his home in eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, by unknown assailants. He was also a columnist who had a pending court battle with King Mswati III over the move to rename the country Eswatini by decree. The human rights lawyer also chaired the Multi-Stakeholders Forum (MSF), a collaboration of political parties and civil society groups working to amplify calls for democratic reforms. In April 2018, King Mswati changed the country's name when it held its golden jubilee. In 2014,Â Maseko was sentenced to two years in prison, with the editor of news magazine The Nation, Bheki Makhubu, for contempt of court over articles critical of the government and judiciary. The human rights landscape in Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy remains characterised by serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and repression of pro-democracy activists.
