The head of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva has praised Zambia's efforts to reform its economy and urged its creditors to restructure the country's debts. Zambia defaulted on its debt in November 2020, the first African country to do so after the Covid-19 pandemic. Georgieva applauded Zambia's efforts to reform its economy, saying it had done its part and urging its creditors to do theirs. She said the IMF had reached an understanding in principle with China to restructure almost U.S.$6 billion Zambia owes Beijing, one of its main creditors. However, the country's debt problem predates the pandemic. The government, under former President Edgar Lungu from 2015, more than doubled Zambia's debt as a percentage of GDP while corruption and wasteful expenditure exacerbated the situation, which Lungu's former ruling party rejects. Current President Hakainde Hichilema, elected in 2021, pledged to tackle corruption and secured U.S.$1.3 billion in IMF support for Zambia's debt with reforms that cut wasteful spending.
