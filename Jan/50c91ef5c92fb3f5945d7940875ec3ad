Nigeria holds its presidential and National Assembly elections on 25 February and governorship elections in various states on 11 March. Sierra Leone follows Nigeria as it holds elections in June, while Liberia will follow suit in October. One of the topics most debated is the State, and the fate of the impending democratic transition amid the deteriorating national security situation. Nigeria has seen a wave of civic and political engagement by young people ahead of the upcoming presidential election. However, the lead-up to the polls has been marred by political violence and unrest.
