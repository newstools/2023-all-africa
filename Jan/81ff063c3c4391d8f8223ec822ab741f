Just ten years after the rescue of Mali's official government by the French military Operation Serval, renamed Operation Barkhane a few months later, the security situation in that country remains structurally more fragile than in 2013. The conflict, that has now become structural and deeply rooted, is presently more dangerous and gradually, but inexorably, affecting national cohesion and the affected countries public institutions. Finally, it is larger in scale and its anchorage, previously indigenous, is increasingly regional. It asserts itself more each year in the face of an international community scalded by disappointing results, here and elsewhere, and above all largely absorbed by the very priority war in Ukraine.           Centre for Strategies and Security for the Sahel Sahara's Ahmedou Ould Abdallah writes that in the Sahel, few or no lessons have yet to be learnt from similar, high-profile conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia or Yemen.
