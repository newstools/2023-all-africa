Born in South Africa and exiled to neighbouring eSwatini, Regina Twala was one of southern Africa's most important intellectuals: a pioneering writer, academic, political activist and feminist.  Twala stood at the forefront of politics in both South Africa and eSwatini. She spoke out loudly, braving the censure of men who preferred women to be quiet and in the home. Her prolific output includes as many as five book manuscripts, almost all lost as Twala struggled to be published due to the racist gatekeeping mechanisms of apartheid-era South Africa. Why, then, has she been all but forgotten? That's the question a new book sets out to answer. In the process Written Out: The Silencing of Regina Gelana Twala restores Twala to her rightful place in history, writes Joel Cabrita for The Conversation.
