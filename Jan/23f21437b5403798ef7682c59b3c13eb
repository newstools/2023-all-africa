As artificial intelligence technologies like Chat GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) become more widely adopted, there is growing concern about the potential impact on employment in various industries.           In Zimbabwe, the adoption of Chat GPT is likely to have significant implications for the economy as a whole, with potential impacts on a range of sectors, writes Taedzwa Chikono for New Zimbabwe.           Chat GPT is a type of artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI. It is based on a machine learning model called a transformer, which was introduced in a 2017 paper by researchers at Google. Since its development, Chat GPT has become widely used in a variety of industries and applications, and it has been the subject of much research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.           Although the OpenAI initiative, which includes the Chat GPT technology, is not currently available in Zimbabwe, many Zimbabweans are accessing it using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks).           The chatbot can be used for programming and data analysis tasks. It can be trained to think and analyse complex data sets and generate useful outputs. This could be a major asset for businesses in Zimbabwe, as it could be used to analyse customer data and develop better strategies for their products and services.
