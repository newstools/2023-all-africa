The leader of opposition party Pastef, Ousmane Sonko, has been charged with the alleged rape of 20-year-old beauty salon employee Adji Sarr. In February 2021, Sarr accused Sonko, a longstanding national member of parliament, of rape, leading to his arrest. Then-46-year-old Ousmane Sonko, the youngest candidate to run in the 2019 presidential election that ended with him in third place, accused President Macky Sall, the Interior Minister Antoine Felix Diome, and the Prosecutor of the Republic, Bassirou Gueye, of plotting to remove him.           The news of Sonko's arrest on March 3, 2021, led to clashes in the capital, Dakar, in which five people were killed. The woman also said that she is pregnant as a result of the rape. Sonko, president of opposition party Pastef, is widely seen as President Macky Sall's greatest potential political challenger in the 2024 general elections. The protests after his arrest has been spurred on by broader, long-standing grievances with Sall's administration. Recently journalist Pape Alé Niang was released on bail on charges related to a November 3 video that Dakarmatin published, in which Niang reported on the contents of a gendarmerie report that allegedly exonerated Ousmane Sonko.
