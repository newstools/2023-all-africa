The pilot registration to test the voter registration equipment will take place in February 2023, and will be held in administrative posts in 15 districts where no municipal elections will be held, according to a decision of the National Elections Commission. It's intended to test the equipment that will be used in the full voter registration that begins on April 20 and ends on June, 3. Mozambique's National Elections Commission (CNE) approved a proposal that schedules October 11, 2023 as the date for the sixth municipal elections across the country. The municipal elections will be the first test of the new CNE and its Chairperson Anglican Bishop Carlos Matsinhe.
