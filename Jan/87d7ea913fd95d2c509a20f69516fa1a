Kenya's former president and facilitator of the East African Community-led peace process in eastern DR Congo, Uhuru Kenyatta, has met with Bertrand Bisimwa, president of the M23 rebel group in a meeting held in the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa, on January 12. Kenyatta's office said in a statement that the rebels agreed to continue their withdrawal. In December 2022, M23 rebels started withdrawing from positions they had earlier captured in an effort to give peace a chance. In 2022, at least 450,000 people were displaced in the new offensive by the Tutsi-led rebel group, which the DRC government, the European Union and a United Nations expert group said is supported by neighbouring Rwanda. The M23 conquered swaths of territory in the eastern DR Congo since it launched its latest offensive in late 2021. However, while Rwanda denies any involvement in the M23's resurgence, accusations against the nation have led to a serious diplomatic crisis in the region.
