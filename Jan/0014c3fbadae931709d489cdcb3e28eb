Cameroon's government has deployed at least 100 troops to Gayama, a village on the border with Nigeria, after clashes between Cameroonian separatists and Nigerian herders left at least 12 people dead.           Officials say the fighting broke out after herders who crossed the border in search of food for their cattle refused to pay taxes the rebels demanded.           Abdoulahi Aliou, the highest-ranking government official in Menchum, the administrative unit in charge of Gayama, said the rebels killed two herders immediately upon their refusal to pay. The surviving herders, who are ethnic Fulani from Taraba and Benue states, returned home and organized a counterattack.           Aliou said the herders came back in huge numbers, attacked separatist camps, and killed at least four fighters. Six civilians, including the traditional ruler of Munkep village and his son, were also killed in the clashes.           This is not the first time Cameroon's anglophone separatists have attacked Nigerians along the border.           In June 2022, villagers in western Akwaya town said armed men believed to be rebels carried out a series of attacks that killed at least 30 people, including five Nigerian merchants.           The separatists have been fighting since 2017 to carve out an English-speaking state from French-speaking majority Cameroon. The U.N. says the conflict has left more than 3,500 people dead and 750,000 displaced.
