The human rights landscape in Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy remains characterised by serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and repression of pro-democracy activists. The assassination of human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko to be killedÂ has again sparked a challenge from civil society organisations to King Mswati, who they accuse of involvement in the murder. Previously protests escalated in 2021 but were met with deadly force from the police and the army.
