Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said in its World Report 2023 that African leaders failed to tackle widespread abuses against civilians by state security forces and non-state armed groups and insufficiently prioritized justice for victims of atrocities across the continent. The report reveals that government forces or non-state armed groups have been implicated in abuses against civilians in at least 15 armed conflicts, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso, and South Sudan.           This comes after the Institute for Security Studies questioned whether Africa's leaders have the sustained political will to take bold decisions, implement existing frameworks and pursue long-term solutions to address two decades of violent extremism across the continent.
