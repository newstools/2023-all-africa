The European Union's foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell has urged Pretoria to use its ties with Russia to convince Moscow to stop its war on Ukraine. Borrell's trip to South Africa is the latest in a whirlwind week that has seen visits by both Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.      Analysts say the flurry of diplomatic activity comes as the West and Russia both seek South Africa's support regarding the war in Ukraine. Pretoria has strong historic ties with Moscow and has taken an officially neutral stance on the conflict, to the dismay of Washington and Brussels. 2022 was a year of significant political and economic challenges for African countries. Already reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the war between Russia and Ukraine and its economic fallout brought more pain as high food and fuel prices worsened the political instability many countries were facing. At the same time, Africa is becoming increasingly important to countries and companies seeking the minerals needed to transition to renewable energy that will see the powers of the United States, China, Russia and European countries vie for access to those resources.
