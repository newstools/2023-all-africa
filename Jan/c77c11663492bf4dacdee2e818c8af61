The Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) has informed its customers and the public of its new regulations of power shedding due to low energy with huge consumption to serve everyone.           LEC says as a result of the increase in energy demand, it has exceeded its 27MW contracted from Cl energies of Cote d'Ivoire to help compensate for its energy supply deficit which represent the maximum allocation available to each CLSG country.           It further assured its customers that an additional supply of electricity is planned for next dry season to address the constant problem of energy supply deficit in the dry season.
