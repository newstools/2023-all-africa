U.S. special operations forces have killed a senior figure of the Islamic State (IS) group in remote northern Somalia, officials announced. Officials say Bilal al-Sudani was killed in a special military operation and was a "key facilitator" for the "Islamic State" group's expansion.           "This action leaves the United States and its partners safer and more secure, and it reflects our steadfast commitment to protecting Americans from the threat of terrorism at home and abroad,"  U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement. According to U.S. Media reports, al-Sudani was involved in recruiting and training fighters for the al-Qaida-linked group al-Shabaab before he joined IS.
