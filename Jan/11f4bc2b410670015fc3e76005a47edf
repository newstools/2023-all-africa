The Global Fund has announced it will be releasing U.S.$587 million to the government of Uganda for battling malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. HIV/AIDS will receive U.S.$288 million, TB U.S.$31 million, and malaria U.S.$267 million. Health Ministry Permanent Secretary Diana Atwine said the country would make a significant shift in the battle against malaria, with the focus turning from treatment to prevention, especially at the household level. Atwine said focusing on households is necessary since the gains in reduction of the past five years seem to have stagnated and the health ministry's interventions do not seem to be sufficient. Uganda has qualified for the fund because of proper utilisation and direction of previous funding.
