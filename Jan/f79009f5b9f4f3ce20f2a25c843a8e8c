Malawi is facing its worst cholera outbreak in two decades. The outbreak started early in 2022 and has, so far, resulted in over 18,000 cases and the loss of 750 lives. It's also forced the closure of schools and many businesses.           Cholera is a disease caused and spread by bacteria - specifically Vibrio cholerae - which you can get by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. It's an old disease which has mostly affected developing countries, many of which are in Africa. Between 2014 and 2021 Africa accounted for 21% of cholera cases and 80% of deaths reported globally.           African governments must acknowledge that the burden of cholera is huge, writes Samuel Kariuki for The Conversation, and it could get worse unless governments put measures in place to control and prevent outbreaks by addressing water and hygiene infrastructure.
