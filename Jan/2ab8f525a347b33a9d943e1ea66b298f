The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, says the EU "firmly urges Rwanda to stop supporting the M23" - the "March 23 Movement" operating in the eastern DR Congo. He also called on Kigali to press the M23 rebels to comply with a call by regional leaders at a "mini-summit" last November to cease hostilities and withdraw from territory it had recently seized. The leaders called for a "cessation of hostilities in general" and in in particular of M23 attacks against the DRC's troops and United Nations peacekeepers.
