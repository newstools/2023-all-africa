Conducted in early December 2022, the results released by Atedo N. A. Peterside Foundation, ANAP, Foundation showed that 23% of voters were willing to vote for Peter Obi if the presidential election were to be conducted. The frontrunners are Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the former governor of Lagos, and Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), a former vice-president. But a surge in support for Labour Party's candidate Obi has analysts and voters wondering about the potential for a major upset, reports Mail & Guardian. The manifesto of Obi, the Labour Party's 'progressive alternative' to the two established political parties, blends security, national cohesion and inclusive governance as a theme. Obi has pledged to diligently serve the country if elected in next month's presidential election. He promised Nigerians that he would eradicate poverty and insecurity challenges in the country if elected. Eighteen presidential candidates will participate in Nigeria's polls on 25 February. The new president will be sworn in on 29 May and will be constitutionally mandated to manage Nigeria's security governance architecture between 2023 and 2027. This election - the seventh since the country's return to democracy in 1999 - will significantly impact policy direction.
