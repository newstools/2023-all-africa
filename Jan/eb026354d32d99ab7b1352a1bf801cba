Women in Kenya's Laikipia North sub county are taking action against an invasive cactus that has been killing their livestock and making their land difficult to cultivate. Introduced by the British during the colonial period as a form of natural fencing, Opuntia Stricta has become incredibly invasive, but the 203 members of theÂ Ilpolei Twala Cultural Manyatta Women group are using a machine to grind it to a pulp, which they use to produce biogas. Agricultural waste can serve as a source of energy when processed for gas that can be used for cooking, preventing deforestation and providing a much cleaner fuel source, especially in rural areas.
