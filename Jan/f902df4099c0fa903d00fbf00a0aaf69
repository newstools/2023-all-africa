The Nigerian government has reopened the Niger Delta Development Commission after a three-year hiatus. The commission was established inÂ 2000 to develop the oil-rich Niger Delta region but numerous cases of corruption, mismanagement and the misuse of funds were reported after millions of dollars were sunk into development of the Niger Delta, which is rich in oil but which has left inhabitants poor. Numerous oil spills over the years, followed by lawsuits against oil giant Shell, have seen fishing villages destroyed and livelihoods of local fishers impacted.
