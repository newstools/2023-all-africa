Conflict and political unrest in north-east Africa - civil wars, uprisings and attacks by armed insurgents - along with the effects of climate change - are fueling a famine, causing displacement, loss of livelihoods, and disrupting of food production and food supply chains. Nearly one in four children under five in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and parts of Kenya are suffering from chronic malnutrition. As a result, child mortality has increased, and many babies and young children who survive will be stunted for life, unable to ever reach their full mental and physical potential, according to Glory Chigogo, a Nairobi-based communications specialist. In an appeal for increased international assistance for the food crisis in Somalia, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield blamed the combination of Covid, conflict, and climate for the rising threat of famine in Somalia. She announced an additionalk $4 million in U.S. food assistance to combat the suffering.
