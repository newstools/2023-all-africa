Reports say around 50 women were snatched as they gathered fruits and plants in the bush because of a severe food shortage near the town of Arbinda, in a part of the Sahel under miliant control.           The nformation only emerged days after that attack when three women escaped. A second group of 15 women and some children from a different village who did not hear about the abduction and set up foraging the next day were also abducted.           Local authorities said that the army and its civilian auxiliaries, who have joined the Volunteers for the Homeland, have searched the area but, so far, have not found the abductees.           Since 2015, Burkina Faso has been grappling with an insurgency led by militant groups which has killed tens of thousands and displaced around two million people. The country has already seen two coups by disgruntled army officers that have put the military in power.
