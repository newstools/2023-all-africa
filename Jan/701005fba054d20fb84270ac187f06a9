The World Health Organisation (WHO) has updated its guidelines on mask-wearing in community settings, Covid-19 treatments, and clinical management. On the wearing of masks, WHO continues to recommend the use of masks by the public in specific situations, and this update recommends their use irrespective of the local epidemiological situation, given the current spread of Covid-19 globally. Masks are recommended following recent exposure to Covid-19 when someone has or suspects they have Covid-19 when someone is at high risk of severe Covid-19, and for anyone in a crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated space. On the issue of isolation, WHO advises that a Covid-19 patient can be discharged from isolation early if they test negative on an antigen-based rapid test. Without testing, for patients with symptoms, the new guidelines suggest 10 days of isolation from the date of symptom onset. Reviewing Covid-19 treatments, WHO has extended its strong recommendation for the use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (also known by its brand name 'Paxlovid'). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was first recommended by WHO in April 2022. WHO strongly recommends its use in mild or moderate Covid-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization.
