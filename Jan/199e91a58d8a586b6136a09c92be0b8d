The murder of Edwin Chiloba, a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQI+) activist whose body was discovered concealed in a metal box has sparked outrage with rights crusaders expressing deep concern over intolerance. Chiloba was a prominent fashion model and LGBTQI+ activist. Reacting to reports on his cruel murder, the Kenya Human Rights Commission termed escalation of violence against the LGBTQI+ community as worrisome. Stephen Mutoro, the Secretary General of the Consumers Federation of Kenya also condemned the brutal murder. The killing of Chiloba has reignited debate about LGBTQI+ rights in Kenya. In April 2022, another LGBTQI+ member Sheila Lumumba's body was discovered in Nairobi days after she went missing. While same-sex relations remain outlawed in Kenya, the country's courts have affirmed rights guaranteed under Article 28 which states that every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected, and 31 which says that every person has the right to privacy.
