Rwandan President Paul Kagame threatened to evict thousands of Congolese refugees living in Rwanda if the international community continues to blame his country for the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, writes Geoffrey Mutagoma for Voice of America.           This comes after the Congolese government and a recent United Nations report blamed Rwanda for supporting the M23, a mostly Tutsi rebel fighting movement, in the east of nation against the Congo government. Conflict has resulted in thousands fleeing the violence. According to the Rwandan Ministry of Emergency Management, at least 60% of Rwanda's refugee population is Congolese. Since August 2022, some East African Community member countries, including Burundi and Kenya, deployed their forces in the region to end the conflict.
