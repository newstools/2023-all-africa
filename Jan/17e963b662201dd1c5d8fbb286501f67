President Lazarus Chakwera has fired the director of public prosecution, Steven Kayuni, over the controversial arrest of the Director General of the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Martha Chizuma. Chakwera announced the dismissal during a televised national address where he was reacting to the findings of a commission of inquiry he established to investigate the circumstances that led to the arrest of the country's anti-corruption chief. The commission found that Chizuma was arrested a few days after Kanyuni complained to police about statements Chizuma made in January 2022. Chizuma claimed that powerful individuals, including as lawyers, a judge, and government officials, were impeding her efforts to fight corruption in an audio recording that was later released to social media.
