After an International Monetary Fund mission - at the request of Zambian authorities - focused on governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities, the IMF found that corruption flourished under the leadership of former president Edgar Lungu.      While the former ruling party Patriotic Front were quick to come to Lungu's defence, the country's current leader President Hakainde Hichilema pledged to tackle corruption in order to secure $1.3 billion in IMF debt support after Zambia defaulted to creditors.
