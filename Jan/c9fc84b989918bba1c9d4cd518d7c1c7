Thanks to the combination of Covid, conflict, and climate, Somalia is once again facing the threat of famine, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said following a weeklong journey to Ghana, Mozambique, Kenya, and Somalia. Speaking to reporters following her journey, the U.S. Representative to the United Nations said: "I had four overarching goals for this trip: to strengthen our partnerships with current and former UN Security Council members; follow up on our priorities from the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, including combating climate change; shine a spotlight on humanitarian issues, particularly famine; and continue our consultations on UN reform to ensure the UN is fit for purpose." In Mogadishu, she announced $41 million in new funding for Somalia "to save lives, stave off famine, and meet humanitarian needs" an appealed to other donors to do more. "There is no reason - none at all - that we cannot get resources to the people in acute need.Â  So let's be ambitious; let's end famine forever, together," she saisd. Ghana and Mozambique are current Security Council members, and Kenya just completed a two-year term. She met with women's organizations and humanitarian groups at each stop, as well as "d a state-of-the-art manufacturing and assembly hub for electronic vehicles in Kenya," she said.
