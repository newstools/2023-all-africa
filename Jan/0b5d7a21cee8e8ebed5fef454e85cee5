All eyes are on Nigeria as it prepares for its general election in February. There is growing concern that insecurity will undermine the process, making it dangerous for voters to go to polling stations, and preventing elections from even being held in some areas. The new Nigerian president will face an exhausting array of challenges right away, ranging from multiple, complex security crises to a disastrously mismanaged economy. According to aÂ Afrobarometer survey, nearly 89% of Nigerians believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, and 77% are dissatisfied with the performance of their democracy. Without consideration to party, religious and ethnic affiliations, Nigerians want a president that can make the country much better than what it is today. With a high unemployment rate, worsening poverty level, escalating insecurity, and rising debt burden fuelling dismay in Nigeria, citizens want a credible and competent leader that can tackle these problems, especially insecurity head-on.
