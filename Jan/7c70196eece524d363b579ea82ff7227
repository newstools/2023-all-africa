The mutilated body of a distinguished Cameroonian journalist and radio presenter Martinez Zogo was found near the capital on Sunday January 22nd, five days after unidentified assailants reportedly abducted him outside a police station.           Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said police officers at the Nkol-Nkondi station heard a loud noise outside on Tuesday evening. When they went out to investigate, they found Zogo's empty car rammed into the station's outer gate.           A black car was seen driving away, which caused the officer to conclude the journalist had been abducted. In 2015, a reporter for Radio France International was imprisoned for two years on terrorism charges that rights groups said were a sham.           Another journalist and outspoken government critic, Paul Chouta, was attacked twice on separate occasions and jailed for nearly two years on charges believed to be politically motivated.
