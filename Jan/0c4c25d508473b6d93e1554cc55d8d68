The United States has imposed visa restrictions on some Nigerians accused of undermining democracy, noting that this was part of the action to advance democracy and tackle corruption in Nigeria. In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, disclosed that the sanctioned individuals, whose names he did not reveal, would be ineligible for a U.S. visa. Blinken clarified that the visa restriction was not targeted at the Nigerian people or the government. The decision to impose visa restrictions, he said, reflects the commitment of the U.S. to support Nigerian aspirations to combat corruption, strengthen democracy and the rule of law. Nigeria's elections in the past have been marred by logistical delays, violence, and claims of fraud and vote-buying. Since 2019, INEC facilities across the country have been attacked over 50 times and its officials and security personnel injured and, in some cases, killed, said Chairperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu. Nigerians are set to elect a new president on February 25, 2023, and will elect governors and local councils two weeks later.
