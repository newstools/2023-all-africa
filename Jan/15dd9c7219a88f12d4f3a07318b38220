The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has announced a plan to create a new Tuberculosis Vaccine Accelerator Council. Speaking at the World Economic Forum Davos, Ghebreyesus said the mechanism should accelerate coordination among funders, global agencies, governments and end users to identify and remove barriers to TB vaccine development. In this way, the Tuberculosis Vaccine Accelerator Council will facilitate the licensing and use of new effective TB vaccines. The Director-General made the announcement considering the urgency of stepping up vaccine development efforts against the disease as the epidemic shows no signs of slowing down. Currently, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, developed in 1921, is the only licensed TB vaccine, according to the WHO. While BCG provides moderate efficacy in preventing severe forms of TB in infants and young children, it does not adequately protect adolescents and adults, who account for nearly 90 per cent of TB transmissions globally.
