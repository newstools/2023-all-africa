The arrangements for the launch of the conference on the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) have been completed, and the dialogue will start in the South Sudanese capital on January 31, 2023, according to Mohamed Abdelhakam, leading member of Sudan's Federal Association and the Forces for Freedom and Change-Central Council (FFC-CC).           On December 5, 2022, the Sudan military concluded a framework agreement with dozens of civilian leaders, in which the generals promised to relinquish much of their political power. The agreement, which has been under quiet discussion for months, is a major accomplishment, but it faces long odds. It excludes former rebels and others who could undermine the transitional government if not brought on board. Tribal violence in South Darfur, West Kordofan, and the Blue Nile region of Sudan during the last quarter of 2022 resulted in thousands of displaced people and hundreds of fatalities. More public demonstrations were planned by resistance committees to mark the anniversary of the October 25 coup d'Ã©tat. Behind closed doors, negotiations between the military junta and several civilian organizations have begun.
