The police have confirmed what they called an airstrike killing dozens of cattle herders in an explosion near the border between the central states of Nasarawa and Benue. Some media have reported that the explosion may have been a botched attack by the Nigerian military. Vanguard reports that the blast was targeted at armed gangs who have been "terrorising" residents along the border areas of the two states. Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule has urged all Fulani people across the state to remain calm, saying that his administration was working with neighbouring Benue State to find a lasting solution to the incessant attacks. The region is prone to frequent disputes and violence over resources between pastoral and farming communities, who are mainly Christian, which is often painted as an ethno-religious conflict. The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) also condemned the herder deaths and called for a full investigation.
