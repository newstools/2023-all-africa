U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a telephone call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, discussed the need to bring an end to ongoing instability in the Oromia region. This came in the backdrop of increasing hostilities between government forces and armed members of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), known by the government as "Shene."           In the latest push for military solution, the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) said a renewed military operation was launched in southern Oromia aimed at destroying the rebel group operating in the area and stabilizing the region, and the army "liberated several villages in Southern Oromia."           On the continued presence of Eritrean and Amhara forces in Tigray, Blinken confirmed there was an "ongoing" withdrawal of Eritrean troops , and that the development was "key to securing a sustainable peace in northern Ethiopia." Secretary Blinken also urged access for international human rights monitors, affirming to PM Abiy Ahmed, "the commitment of the US to support the African Union-led peace process in northern Ethiopia".
