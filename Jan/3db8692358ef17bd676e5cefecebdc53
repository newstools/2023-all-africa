Foreign Affairs Minister Naledi Pandor has called for a diplomatic end to the Ukraine-Ruussia conflict following a visit by Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov. Our sincere wish is that the conflict currently between Russia and Ukraine will soon be brought to a peaceful end through diplomacy and negotiation as we believe this is the desire of all of us around the globe," Pandor said.           This comes amid planned naval drills between South Africa, Russia and China off the east coast from February 17 to February 26, 2023. The proposed military exercises have drawn criticism from official opposition party the Democratic Alliance who accused the African National Congress of taking sides in the Ukraine-Russia conflict despite the ruling government's official neutral stance.
