United Nation's (UN) Deputy Human Rights Chief Nada Al-Nashif has warned that ongoing serious violations of people's basic freedoms in Eritrea "show no sign of improvement".        In addition to the longstanding problem of indefinite military service - which intensified during the recent Tigray conflict in Ethiopia - Al-Nashif insisted that the agreed withdrawal of the Eritrean Defence Force from Ethiopia "remains very slow and largely incomplete".        In a call for greater pressure from the UN Human Rights Council, she called for human rights reforms in Eritrea, the Special Rapporteur noted that the country lacks "rule of law, a constitution, a national assembly, an independent judiciary, and a democratic society. Civic space in Eritrea remains restricted, with no independent media, and dissent is far too often met with arbitrary detention, disappearance, or death."
