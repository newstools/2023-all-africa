Researchers have found that cheaper and more accessible blood testing methods can improve the care of patients with chronic hepatitis B in Africa. Individual patients may interact with the health system, but more so when things are already out of hand when irreversible liver damage has already happened, reports Charles Mpaka for Inter Press Service. In a study published in Nature Communications, the researchers recommend revising the current World Health Organization guidelines on managing the condition. Lead author of the study, Asgeir Johannessen, said that clinicians working in Africa have "repeatedly reported that very few patients in Africa" are eligible for treatment using the current WHO guidelines published in 2015. Africa represents one of the high-burden regions for chronic hepatitis B virus. Of the estimated 316 million people that live with chronic hepatitis B virus infection worldwide, 82 million are in Africa. The research further says that antiviral therapy effectively reduces the risk of complications resulting from hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B diagnosis on the continent has been a luxury. In Malawi, for example, where 5% of the adults are estimated to be infected, virtually no screening or diagnostic system exists.
