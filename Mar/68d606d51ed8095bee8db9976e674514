A Supreme Court judgment - that LGBTQ community members have a right to associate, even though the law considers same-sex marriage illegal - has been met with opposition from the clergy and legislators. A gay rights activist has said the reaction is unwarranted and has left members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer community, fearing for their lives. Catholic-allied MPs have vowed to mobilise for the disbandment of the NGO Board to preempt the imminent registration of a gay rights lobby group. Kenya's Penal Code prohibits same-sex relations and criminalises acts of "gross indecency" and "carnal knowledge against the order of nature". The law stipulates a 14-year jail term for those found guilty of engaging in homosexuality.
