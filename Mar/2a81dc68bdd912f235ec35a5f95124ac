Efforts to strengthen U.S.-Africa relations are in motion, with plans for several high-level delegations to visit the continent, following the December 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Alice Albright who is chairperson of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, established by the U.S. government in 2004, discussed with Carol Castiel of Voice of America, the organization's role in several African countries and its future goals. Albright mentioned several areas of interest, including U.S. President Joe Biden's increased focus on the continent and the creation of a regional power integration compact that will "map the geographic footprint of the West African power pool".
