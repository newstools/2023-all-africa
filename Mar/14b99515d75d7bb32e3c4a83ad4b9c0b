The Malawian government has told refugees whose countries have now attained peace to voluntarily return home. This comes as the government has failed to meet the deadline for relocation of the refugees back to Dzaleka camp in Dowa.        The Dzaleka refugee camp was meant to host about 10,000 refugees. However, it is now home to more than 56,000 refugees, many from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the rest from Burundi, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia. Limited aid at the Dzaleka camp led to refugees holding sporadic protests in November 2022, some of which turned violent. Ndizeye Innocent, a Burundian refugee living in Malawi and pursuing an online degree in healthcare management from Southern New Hampshire University, says, "The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, says refugees like me who are forced to leave their homes have three options to resume their lives: voluntary return to the place they've left, integration in their host country, or resettlement to a third country. For the vast majority of refugees, these so-called 'durable solutions' do not work."
