French President Emmanuel Macron is in Central Africa from March 1, 2023 in 4-nation visit, Voice of America reports. Macron's revamped Africa strategy will be put to the test, with his first stop in Gabon, for a summit on forests. He will also visit Angola, the Republic of Congo and neighbouring DR Congo. Two countries on his list - Gabon and the Republic of Congo -- are former French colonies. His Africa visit follows key setbacks for France, especially in the Sahel region. France also ended military operations in Mali and Burkina Faso, amid deteriorating relationships with the military power-holders, and rising anti-French sentiment.
