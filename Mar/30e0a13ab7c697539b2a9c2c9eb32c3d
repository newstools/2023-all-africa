Food insecurity and competition over access to and use of natural resources exacerbates the root causes of conflict, according to the CGIAR, a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security. Repercussions of the climate crisis can have a variety of effects on food, land, and water systems, diminishing their productivity and raising food poverty while also having the potential to spark conflict. AllAfrica's Jerry Chifamba looks at the impact of extreme climate on conflict in Zimbabwe, while colleague Ish Mafundikwa reports on whether President Emmerson Mngagawa's plans have improved the food situation in the southern African country. AllAfrica's reporting on peacebuilding is supported by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
