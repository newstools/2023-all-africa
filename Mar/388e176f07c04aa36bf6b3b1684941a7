UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres has urged leadersof the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to respect a ceasefire agreement that came into effect on March 7, 2023. M23 rebels clashed with soldiers on two fronts in eastern DR Congo on the same day of the regional ceasefire signing, officials said. Eastern DRC is home to multiple armed groups, including the rebel M23 force, which has been fighting a major campaign against government troops in recent months, supported by the UN mission there, known by its French acronym MONUSCO. DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekdi has in recent months also accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels and called for sanctions against its neighbour.
