Up to 25% of children and adolescents reported that they experienced significant depression and the incidence and hospitalisation rates for new onset eating disorders increased by 60% during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Lancet research. The study compared the rate of children and adolescent hospital emergency visits for suicide attempts that occurred before the pandemic, to the rate that occurred during the pandemic. The study found that the rate of suicide attempts for children and adolescents increased by 22% during the pandemic, compared to before the pandemic. It also found that the rate of hospital emergency visits during the pandemic increased by 39% for girls, and by 6% for boys.
