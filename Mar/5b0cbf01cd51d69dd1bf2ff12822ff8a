An overnight attack on a village in eastern DR Congo, allegedly by Allied Democratic Forces miltants with ties to Islamic State, has left approximately 36 people dead and several villagers still missing.    Mumbere Limbadu Arsene, the head of the civil society group, said the modus operandi suggested that the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) was behind the attack, since no shots were fired.        A United Nations Security Council delegation was due to arrive on March 9, 2023 for a three-day visit to the country, AFP reports.        The visit will follow an advancement by M23 fighters, who are threatening to cut off all road links to Goma, which is the largest city in DR Congo's mineral-rich east.        It also comes as the country steps up pressure on the international community to pursue sanctions against Rwanda for its alleged military support to the M23 rebellion.
