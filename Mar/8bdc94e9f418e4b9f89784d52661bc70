How do we make sure people don't go hungry while also building community, urban biodiversity and using what some consider waste? One way to do it is to make sure that urban communities that have been marginalised due to Apartheid and a continued lack of investment in their communities are reconnected to the skills needed to grow their own food. An award-winning non-profit organization, School Environmental Education and Development (SEED), at Rocklands Primary in Mitchell's Plain, Cape Town has pioneered permaculture initiatives in the local community and underresourced schools for the past 14 years. Through permaculture programmes, SEED helps alleviate poverty in the community and surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to providing nutritious food, it also offers a pathway to employment opportunities. The practice of permaculture focuses on creating sustainable ways of living and self-sufficiency, reports Melody Chironda for allAfrica.
