Ghanaians worldwide have celebrated the country's 66th independence day. On March 6, 1957, Ghana gained independence after 83 years of British colonial rule - becoming the first sub-Saharan African country to achieve independence from Britain. Ho, the Volta Regional capital hosted the national independence parade with the theme of this year's event "Our Unity, Our Strength, Our Purpose". President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in his speech said that the theme serves as a clarion call for Ghanaians to continue to seek out progress for the nation. "Our forebears were united and strong toward a common purpose of attaining independence. It did not matter which ethnic group or religious persuasion they related to, or their standing in society generally. They recognized that colonialism did not collectively inure to their benefit. They were determined to end it, and indeed they did," said Akufo-Addo. Touching on the economic challenges Ghanaians are going through presently, Akufo-Addo emphasized that the government has put in place quite a number of interventions that will soon alleviate the suffering of the people.
