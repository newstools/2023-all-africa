The inaugural Islamic Arts Biennale is underway in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. (Biennales are large and prestigious international art exhibitions held every two years. This important new event for the Muslim world features numerous African artists.        The field of "Islamic art" was defined by Europeans in the 1800s - and hinged on geography, style and historical chronology. So it was inherited from definitions outside the faith.        My hope IS that this biennale puts forth a different definition of and for Islamic arts - one that recognises Islamic philosophies for our present and future, and one that honours the daily lived experiences of the Muslim world.
