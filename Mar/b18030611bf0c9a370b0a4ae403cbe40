Political leaders, the private sector, parliamentarians, development experts and young people from around world have gathred in Doha, Qatar, to once again discuss ideas on how to tackle development challenges bedeviling the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Poverty-related issues will take centre stage and the focus will be on how to transform economies with the help of international trade, structural transformation and science and technology. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres urged the international community - particularly wealthy nations - to step up and help the more than 1.1 billion people in these countries break out of "vicious cycles" and lift themselves out of poverty.
