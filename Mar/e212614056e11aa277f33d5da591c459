DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi has appealed to President Emmanuel Macron of France to assist in applying sanctions on Rwanda for their alleged support of M23 rebels in the east of the country. Rwanda has repeatedly denied any involvement in the conflict in DR Congo's eastern region of Goma, capital of the North Kivu province. Macron was on a four-nation visit in Africa - visiting Gabon, Angola, Republic of Congo and DR Congo. Protesters in DR Congo said Macron was unwelcome as he was not responding to the call for sanctions, Al Jazeera reports.
