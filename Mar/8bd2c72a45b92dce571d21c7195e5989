Bola Ahmed Tinubu, 70, has come out victorious in Nigeria's highly disputed presidential election. Who is this veteran political and why is he widely regarded as a kingmaker and "godfather"?, writes Okeri Ngutjinazo for Deutsche Welle. Sometimes referred to as the political "godfather", Tinubu has been known for exerting power from behind the scenes and using his extensive network to back candidates for office. Tinubu has played major roles in party politics since 1992 when he was elected senator for Lagos West District. He was also governor of Lagos for eight years. Tinubu's support also helped outgoing leader Muhammadu Buhari win two terms in office, in 2015 and 2019. Despite lingering questions about his health, the president-elect has been accused of corruption, money laundering, and operating more than a dozen foreign bank accounts but was never charged and denies wrongdoing. Once he takes up his position as president in June, Tinubu is expected to deal with a long list of problems including security, a currency crisis, fuel, and power shortages, and deeply entrenched corruption, adds Ngutjinazo
