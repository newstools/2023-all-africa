President Cyril Ramaphosa has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the handling of the theft of foreign currency at his farm, according to a leaked and secret report from the Office of the Public Protector, which instead accuses the police and Major-General Wally Rhoode, head of the Presidential Protection Service, of being at fault.        According to reports, findings by deputy public protector Koleka Gcaleka demonstrate that Rhoode's actions were improper in that he abused his authority by starting an unofficial inquiry that used police resources. Rhoode and Rikhotso violated SAPS regulations, according to a report Gcaleka sent to the interested parties for review. She recommended that General Fannie Masemola, the national police commissioner, take proper action against the officers within 60 days. This is despite that the South Africa Revenue Service (Sars) confirmed that it could not find any record that Sudanese businessman Hazim Mustafa, who allegedly paid U.S.$580 000 in cash to buy 20 buffalo from Ramaphosa's Phala Phala farm, declared the cash when he landed at OR Tambo International Airport on December 23, 2019. Gcaleka doesn't believe there is anything suspicious going on.
