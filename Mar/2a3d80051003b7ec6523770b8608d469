The phenomenon of fires from unknown sources has been renewed in the state of North Darfur. The village of Eyal Amin witnessed the ignition of those fires that led to the burning of 95 houses with their entire contents and the displacement of its residents. This happened one week after the return of the geological technical team which was assigned by the government of North Darfur State to investigate the causes of frequent and unknown fires in the village of Melissa which is 265 km southwest of the state. The Executive Director of Al-Twaisha Locality Suleiman Ali Bahar revealed that the village of Eyal Amin has been witnessing fires of an unknown cause since the last February 15th, pointing out that these fires have been repeated for several times and continued to devour citizens' homes with their entire contents of food stocks, furniture, and personal belongings, due to the lack of a means of extinguishing.
