Kenya Power, the country's sole electricity distributor, said it had restored electricity to some parts of the country affected by a nationwide blackout on Saturday, March 4, 2023, and was working on bringing it back to remaining areas, Deutsche Welle reports. The power utility said in a statement that indications are that the outage was caused by a fault that occurred on the Suswa-Loyangalani high-voltage power transmission line. Power has been restored to Eldoret, Kisumu and Nakuru and the electricity had also returned to at least one part of the capital Nairobi, according to reports.
