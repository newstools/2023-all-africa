The war between Ethiopia's federal government and Tigrayan forces left many children orphaned or separated from their families, writes Mulugeta Atsbeha for Voice of America. The impact of those emotional wounds linger for the children, experts say, as the challenges of healing the war-torn nation begin.        Now that there is a peace deal, advocates say mental health services should be offered to children as they reenter the classroom. According to a 2022 report by the U.N., 1.39 million children in the Tigray region are out of school because of Ethiopia's civil war.
