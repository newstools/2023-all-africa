JPMorgan Chase is the biggest fossil fuel financier in the world fueling climate chaos, according to the Rainforest Action Network's report titled Banking on Climate Chaos. This report exposes how this financing also prolongs civil unrest in Mozambique by using unstable situations to force fossil fuel projects. A liquified natural gas project by TotalEnergies in the Cabo Delgado region is on pause after armed groups killed dozens of their workers in Palma in 2021. The company's CEO visited the region to assess whether it can resume the project. At the same time, most displaced people haven't received the land, money, or safety promised to them since the project started years ago, casting doubt on this statement. Rainforest Action Network says the project fits the pattern of energy companies exploiting the global south to pipeline energy and profit to the global north - with full backing from banks like JPMorgan Chase.
