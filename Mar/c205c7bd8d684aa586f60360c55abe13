Experts have called for a Congo Basin Climate Science Initiative to deploy the scientific underpinning of a forest protection plan. Attending a webinar ahead of the One Forest Summit, they outlined the importance of Congo Basin forests. French President Emmanuel Macron and Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba will co-host the One Forest Summit in Libreville from March 1-2, and it is expected to support new opportunities for regional growth compatible with maintaining the basin's crucial biodiversity and its crucial role in climate regulation. There's some evidence that rainfall generated from the Congo Basin rainforests, from evapo-transpiration trees, putting water back into the atmosphere, is traveling as far as the Sahel and the headwaters of the Nile and supporting the agriculture that around 300 million Africans rely on.
