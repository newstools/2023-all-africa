Kenya has rolled out a campaign using the world's first vaccine against malaria to innoculate more than 400,000 children against the mosquito-borne disease, Vicoria Amunga reports for Voice of America. Health officials say malaria kills more than 12,000 Kenyans each year and more than half a million people in sub-Saharan Africa, most of them children. Amid the vaccine drive, the Kenya Medical Research Institute has detected an invasive mosquito in the Marsabit county in the northern region, Eunice Anyango Owinohe writes for Conversation Africa.  The detection is a major risk to Kenya, where malaria has been primarily existing on the coastal and western parts of the country. The latest detection of Anopheles stephensi is in urban and peri-urban areas and this mosquito thrives in urban settings.
