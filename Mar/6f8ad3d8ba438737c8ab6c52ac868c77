As conflict and violence spread across the Sahel, Africa's biggest film festival, hosted in Burkina Faso, promotes fellowship in times of crisis, writes Richard Tiene for Deutsche Welle. The West African nation is hosting the 28th edition of the Ouagadougou Film and Television Festival (FESPACO) - Africa's biggest film festival - which takes place every two years, honouring and promoting African filmmakers, and showcasing hundreds of African films in various categories. This year's chosen theme, Cinema of Africa and Culture of Peace, also reflects the tense security context in Burkina Faso and Mali. Since the last edition of the biennial festival in Ouagadougou, the country's troubles have increased. Successive governments' failures to stop the extremist violence triggered two military coups in 2022, with each junta leader promising security - but delivering few results. In February 2023, over 70 soldiers were killed, dozens wounded and give taken hostage following an ambush on a military convoy in northern Burkina Faso. The fighting has sown discord among a once-peaceful population, pitting communities and ethnicities against each other. Many hope FESPACO will help boost domestic unity and strengthen ties with other countries.
