Uganda's Education Minister John Chrysostom Muyingo has said the government is in the final stages of presenting to parliament, amendments in the Education Act 2008 to ensure parents and guardians enrol all children under their care, in school. Muyingo spoke of the plan at the second National Afri-Child Conference that brought together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss strategies for scaling up evidence-based child-focused research, and lessons learned to inform policies and programmes. Parents will now be forced to meet their obligations and enrol all children in schools, since the government will also be enforcing free education throughout the country. The amendments will be based on research that has identified the gaps that need to be addressed to ensure education for all in Uganda.
