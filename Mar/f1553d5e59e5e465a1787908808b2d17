At current rates, it will take almost another three centuries to bring about equality for women and girls, according to the United Nations (UN). That is why every year in March, the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) convenes to discuss the pervasive injustices, violence, and discrimination that women continue to experience throughout the world. Hobbled by persistent inequalities, about 383 million women and girls live in extreme poverty, and every 11 minutes, a woman or girl is killed by someone in her own family. These are some of the reasons why the CSW remains relevant and has been a vitally important fixture on the United Nations calendar since its inception, shortly after the establishment of the UN itself.
