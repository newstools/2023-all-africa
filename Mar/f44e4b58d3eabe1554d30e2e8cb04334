Amnesty International has called on the Ethiopian government to lift the ban on social media platforms such as Facebook, Tik Tok, YouTube and Telegram. Amnesty's Flavia Mwangovya said authorities "continue to violate people's right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information". As Ethiopian courts support a motion to cut short the Tigray inquiry, observers fear the move could widen the divide between African and Western nations, Isaac Mugabi writes for Deutsche Welle. The conflict between Ethiopia and the Tigray region escalated into a full-scale war in November 2020. Millions of people were displaced and fled to neighbouring countries such as Sudan.
