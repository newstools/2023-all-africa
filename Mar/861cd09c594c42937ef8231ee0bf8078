Tunisia's President Kais Saied has denounced racism barely 10 days after declaring a crackdown on illegal immigration and using language the African Union deemed to be "racialized hate speech". During a statement on February 21, 2023, Saied called for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants, describing migration as a plot to alter Tunisia's demographics so that it becomes more African and less Arab. Saied's remarks have sparked an uproar and criticism from the African Union. Hundreds protested in Tunis on February 25. Saied's speech was the most recent in a string of attacks on democratic norms. He took power in 2019 and has been on a power grab ever since, sacking the government, freezing then dissolving parliament, and pushing through a new constitution granting him nearly unlimited powers.
