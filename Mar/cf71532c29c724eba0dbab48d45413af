Eight years after journalist and pro-democracy activist, Itai Dzamara went missing, authorities are yet to provide a progress report on their investigation efforts to ensure his family receives justice, truth, and reparation, reports Amnesty International. Lucia Masuka, executive director of Amnesty International Zimbabwe, said that "the failure of Zimbabwean authorities to account for the enforced disappearance of Itai Dzamara, eight years after he was last seen, speaks volumes about the lack of political will to account for him." Before his disappearance in 2015, Dzamara was a critic of then president, the late Robert Mugabe, and was subjected to harassment by the authorities. The Mugabe administration at the time denied any involvement in Dzamara's disappearance and President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration has maintained that position. His wife, Sheffra, is still waiting for closure.
