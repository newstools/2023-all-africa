Tropical Cyclone Freddy - which is threatening communities in Madagascar and Mozambique for a second time in as many weeks - could become the longest-lasting storm of its kind on record, the World Meteorological Office (WMO) has said. WMO continues to monitor the "remarkable" tropical storm, which has cut a destructive path across the two countries since it first developed a month ago. At least 21 people have been killed, and thousands more displaced, with the latest deaths reported in Madagascar on March 6, 2023. Tropical Cyclone Freddy developed off the North Australian coast, becoming a named storm on February 6. It then crossed the entire South Indian Ocean before slamming into Madagascar on February 21, and then Mozambique three days later. The storm brought heavy rains and flooding over several days before looping back towards the Mozambique Channel, picking up energy from the warm waters along the way, and then moving towards the southwestern coast of Madagascar.        WMO continues to keep an eye on whether the storm will become the world's longest lasting tropical cyclone. The current record holder, Hurricane/Typhoon John in the Central Pacific, lasted 31 days in 1994.
