The 2023 Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) reveals a whopping US$3.99 billion is required to help around 20.1 million Ethiopians who are in need of humanitarian assistance, Addis Standard reports. According to the response plan, jointly prepared by the Ethiopian government and humanitarian partners, an estimated 13 million of these much-needed funds are meant for the humanitarian response in drought-affected areas alone. The Ethiopia war with Tigray region also resulted in people fleeing and resettling in refugee camps where food shortages are dire, largely due to ravaging drought.
