Patients have been turned away at clinics after workers affiliated with the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) downed tools in a national strike. People from villages in the Eastern Cape queued for over seven hours for help at the Lusikisiki Village Clinic only to learn that the strike action would deny them service. The strike comes despite a court interdict to halt the action and follows protracted, unsuccessfull wage negotiation attempts between the union and the government. According to GroundUp, Nehawu served the department with a notice to strike on February 24, 2023 after wage negotiations deadlocked. The department offered a 4.7% increase while unions demanded between 10% and 12%. Among the demands, is for a R2,500 housing allowance and a bursary scheme for the children of public servants. "Our demands that we put on the table in 2022 for 3% in progression, housing allowance and other things are still valid. We are very much fixed on saying that we are not going to start negotiations in 2023 until the 2022 issues are resolved," said collective bargaining officer, Zola Sapetha.
